Pandemic Legacy: Season 1,Mutating diseases are spreading around the world - can your team save humanity?,2015,2,4,4,60,60,13,2.83,Strategy,  Thematic,"A legacy game is a variant of tabletop board games in which the game itself is designed, through various mechanics, to change permanently over the course of a series of sessions.


== History ==
Game designer Rob Daviau claims to have come up with the idea at a work meeting after jokingly asking why the murderous characters in Clue are always invited back to dinner. Realizing that each new game resets, Daviau thought about what it would be like if everyone would remember who the murderer was, and he pitched the idea of a Clue legacy game to Hasbro.

While that idea was rejected, Daviau was later asked to use the mechanic in a new version of Risk. Risk Legacy was released in 2011 and was his first game to use this format.
Daviau followed up with an award-winning Pandemic variant, Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, which was released in 2015 to positive reviews and praised as a leap forward in modern board game design. Daviau continues to develop legacy games and co-developed a mechanic, the Echo System, to retain permanent changes through subsequent games in a franchise.
Daviau cited his work on Betrayal at House on the Hill (which was later adapted into a legacy version) and Trivial Pursuit: DVD – Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition as predecessors to the legacy idea. The latter was designed in such a way that pre-programmed games sorted the cards by difficulty. This caused some vocal backlash as the game was perceived by many to have a more definite end than other versions.


== Common mechanics and themes ==
Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. As such they have been compared to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. New rules can be introduced as the campaign goes on, allowing for the game to expand both mechanically and thematically. Games can use the expanding campaign as a mode of storytelling; Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 uses a three-act structure to tell its story. Daviau describes legacy games as ""experiential"" in contrast to traditional games, which are ""repeatable"". He compared his legacy games to that of a concert where you ""buy a ticket for an experience"" while Haoran Un of Kotaku describes the idea as ""avant-garde performance art"".
Legacy games break certain covenants that players expect from traditional board games. Permanent, physical changes can occur to components based on game outcomes and player choices. For instance players might be instructed to write names on cards, place stickers on the game board, or destroy some components. This causes each copy of the game to be unique at the end and has earned the legacy genre criticism in that there is a finite amount of replayability. Some games have been designed to be replayable with refill packs or non-permanent stickers while others are still playable with the final permanent changes once the campaign is over.

Terraforming Mars,Compete with rival CEOs to make Mars habitable and build your corporate empire.,2016,1,5,3,120,120,12,3.24,Strategy ,,"Terraforming Mars is a board game for 1 to 5 players designed by Jacob Fryxelius and published by FryxGames in 2016, and thereafter by 12 others, including Stronghold Games. In Terraforming Mars, players take the role of corporations working together to terraform the planet Mars by raising the temperature, adding oxygen to the atmosphere, covering the planet's surface with water and creating plant and animal life. The game incorporates elements of resource management, engine building, and strategic planning. Players compete to earn the most victory points, which are measured by their contribution to terraforming and to human infrastructure. These goals are achieved by collecting income and resources which allow them to play various projects, represented by cards that increase their income or resources, build infrastructure, or directly contribute to terraforming the planet. The game was received positively by fans and critics, and received numerous awards.


== Gameplay ==

Players represent competing corporations who all have a stake in terraforming Mars. The game board depicts the planet's surface, which is represented by an array of 61 contiguous hexes. Each hex represents about 1% of Mars' surface area. Onto these hexes, players can place oceans, greeneries, cities, and other special tiles. The object of the game is for players to complete three terraforming conditions: raise the atmosphere's oxygen level to 14%; raise the temperature from −30 to +8 degrees Celsius; and cover 9% of Mars' surface by ocean (represented in-game as having 9 ocean tiles placed on Mars).
Players accomplish these goals by playing cards that represent various technologies or buildings used to terraform Mars. The game is played over a number of generations, each represented as one game round. A generation begins with players drawing cards, then players take turns performing actions (which can be playing cards, using the ability of a card already in play or paying for one of the several actions depicted on the board). Once all players have finished taking actions, players collect income and resources according to their production of the different resources, then the next generation begins.
One of the unique aspects in Terraforming Mars is the Terraforming Rating (TR) system. Whenever a player performs an action that advances one of the terraforming conditions, the player's TR increases. A player's TR not only represents the victory points they have earned during the game, but is also added to a player's money income when collecting income and resources at the end of each generation.
The game ends at the end of any generation when the three terraforming conditions have been met. Then, players count up their points, which come from their TR at the end of the game, cities and greeneries that they have placed on Mars, achievements they have claimed during the game and cards they have played, and the player with the highest score wins.


== Expansions and spin-offs ==


=== Expansions ===
Five expansions have been released:

Hellas and Elysium (2017), which adds a new double-sided board representing two new regions of Mars, with each region having its own terrain layout, milestones, and end-game achievements
Venus Next (2017), which adds a new side-board representing Venus as a new terraforming opportunity and new Venus-related cards for the deck
Prelude (2018), which adds Prelude cards that players take during setup to jump-start their production and terraforming
Colonies (2018), which adds areas around the Solar System for players to colonize and travel to, providing alternative ways of getting resources without having to play cards
Turmoil (2019), which adds a Martian government with several political factions, each with their own agendas, which players can influence to gain various bonuses
Future expansions:

Prelude 2 (planned 07/2024), which adds 5 new corporation cards, 25 prelude cards, and 24 project cards
Milestones and Awards (planned 07/2024), which allows players to randomize 35 milestones and 35 awards
Automa Solo Expansion (planned 07/2024), which provides a new solo player mode
Arabia Terra, Amazonis Planitia, Terra Cimmeria, Vastitas Borealis (planned 07/2024), which adds four new boards representing new expansion outposts of Mars, with each board having its own terrain layout, milestones, and end-game achievements


=== Promos ===
Several seasonal promotional cards have been released that include new corporations, preludes, and project cards.


=== Card Adaptation ===
Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition, a simplified card game version of the original, released in 2021. A legacy variant and a dice game are also scheduled for release. 


=== Video Game Adaptation ===
A video game adaptation of Terraforming Mars, developed by Asmodee Digital, was released in October 2018. Matt Thrower of Strategy Gamer considered the adaptation to have ""too many rough edges to recommend"". However, in a list of Best Board Games On PC from the same site he later revised this opinion, saying ""developer Asmodee Digital has stepped up the plate with a host of updates. And while the interface remains a bit obtuse, the game itself is shining as it should.""


=== Online Play ===
Terraforming Mars can also be played on Steam and Board Game Arena.


== Inspiration ==
The base game rulebook acknowledges Kim Stanley Robinson and his Mars trilogy as ""great inspiration"" to the game. Additionally, the example players in the rulebook are named Kim, Stanley and Robinson.


== Reception ==
Terraforming Mars received highly positive reviews following its release. Reviewing from Ars Technica, Aaron Zimmerman criticised the ""serious art and component weaknesses"", but praised the engine-building mechanism, the uniqueness of cards, and variable starting corporate cards, concluding that it is ""a crunchy, engaging brain-burner with amazing theme"". It was subsequently listed on Ars Technica as one of its 20 best games of 2016. Matt Thrower from IGN also commented positively on the game's replayability. Editors from Polygon stated that the card system was ""gripping"" and described the game arc was ""gratifying""; Terraforming Mars was also listed as its runner up for best game of 2016 and best strategy game of 2016. Similarly, Popular Mechanics named Terraforming Mars as one of its 50 best games of the year. Vulture called it ""the best high strategy game of 2016."" In an article for The Guardian, Dan Jolin said that the projects ""synergise in many different and rewarding ways"", and stated that ""isn't just a great science game, it's a great game full stop"".
The game was nominated for the 2017 Kennerspiel des Jahres award for Best Strategy Game of the Year. It won Best Family/Adult Game at the 2017 Deutscher Spiele Preis. From  2019 to 2020, Terraforming Mars peaked as the 3rd ranked board game on BoardGameGeek.
The expansions to the game were also received positively. Hellas and Elysium and Venus Next were the two runners-up for the Golden Geek award for the best expansion to a game in 2017. Prelude has been received very well by critics for speeding up the beginning phase by giving each player extra abilities at the start of the game. Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition was also reviewed by Charlie Hall from Polygon, who described the game's multiple phases as interesting, but critiqued that it was ""a smaller, mostly card-based game leaves behind a few vestigial remnants from the original"" that still contained ""redundant icons and concepts"". Hall additionally criticised the components and rulebook. Reviewing from Ars Technica, Aaron Zimmerman stated that the game was a combination of Race for the Galaxy and the original title, and complimented the engagement and engine-building mechanics. Zimmerman considered that the game's player interaction was ""arguably more"" than the base game, and considered its components as superior.


== Media tie-ins ==
In 2021, a tie-in novel based on the game by author Jane Killick called In the Shadow of Deimos was published by Aconyte Books. In 2022, a second novel titled Edge of Catastrophe was released by Jane Killick.

Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition,"Build an intergalactic empire through trade, research, conquest and grand politics. ",2017,3,6,6,240,480,14,4.26,Strategy,  Thematic,"Twilight Imperium is a strategy board game produced by Fantasy Flight Games in the genre of science fiction and space opera. It was designed by Christian T. Petersen and was first released in 1997. The game is in its fourth edition (2017), which has large changes over previous editions. It is known for the length of its gameplay (often greater than six hours), and its in-depth strategy (including military, political, technological and trade).


== Game background ==
The game's premise is a large-scale space opera. It is set in the unstable power vacuum left after the centuries-long decline and collapse of the previously dominant Lazax race. The old galactic central capital, Mecatol Rex, located in the center of the map is maintained by custodians who maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council. Players assume the roles of rising empires on the fringes of the galaxy, vying for military and political control, until one finally becomes sufficiently dominant to take over as a new galactic emperor.


== Development history ==


=== First edition ===
The first edition of Twilight Imperium was conceived by Christian T. Petersen while working as an importer of European comics. Drawing from a background of working at a Danish game importer, Petersen designed, published, and assembled the first edition of the game single-handedly. The final version of the first edition debuted at the Origins Game Fair in 1997. Fantasy Flight set up demos of the game in a high-traffic corridor to garner more attention, and ended up selling out of all of their available copies in under two days.


=== Second edition ===
The second edition of Twilight Imperium was published in 2000. It was the first edition of the game to feature art by Scott Schomburg and Brian Schomburg. It also introduced plastic spaceship pieces, replacing cardboard tokens that were used in the first edition.


=== Third edition ===
The third edition of Twilight Imperium, published in 2004, was designed at roughly the same time that Petersen was also working on A Game of Thrones, and his desire was to emphasize similar narrative development in this new edition's gameplay. He also looked to the mechanics of Eurogames like Puerto Rico for inspiration of how to represent complex mechanisms simply. The game box proved to be so large that wholesale distributors had to purchase custom-sized shipping cartons in order to make them fit.


=== Fourth edition ===
Development of Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition began in 2015. The original plan for the game was to seek funding on the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter, releasing a product with an MSRP of approximately US$250. Ideas pitched for this version included featuring only the six original races but each with unique ship designs, as well as presenting Mecatol Rex as centrepiece figure instead of a tile. However, this plan was scrapped in the summer of 2016 as the features were proving too costly to create within their budget. The revised version included all previous species introduced into Twilight Imperium, and was released at Gen Con in August 2017. Fourth edition was initially intended as a stand-alone game without any variant rules and expansions, but the expansion Prophecy of Kings was introduced in November 2020.


== Components ==

The game consists of cardboard map tiles, cards, plastic units, cardboard counters, and player sheets. The map is built from hexagonal tiles, each showing up to three planets, empty space, or a red-bordered system containing an obstacle (with additional types added in the expansions). The centre tile is always Mecatol Rex, with the remainder of the galaxy built out in concentric rings.
Plastic playing pieces represent various starship classes and ground forces. Players are limited to the number of playing pieces provided with the game, except for fighters and ground forces. Counters are included for record-keeping, including command tokens, control markers, trade goods, and extra fighter and ground force counters. Cards are used to track planet ownership, trade agreements, technologies, public objectives, secret objectives, special actions, and policy voting agendas.


== Gameplay ==

Three to six (eight, with 'Prophecy of Kings') players can play, with games typically taking more than six hours to complete (approx. 1.5 hours per player), although players new to the game can take longer. The game works on a 'victory points' system such that players earn points by completing a combination of public and secret objectives.


=== Setup ===
Each player randomly selects a race to control. Either a pre-designed map can be used, or players can generate a map via a pre-game mechanic whereby each takes turns in placing map tiles to construct a galaxy map with Mecatol Rex at the centre and home systems around the periphery.


==== Factions ====

Players can choose from several alien factions (up to 25 in the 4th edition) to play as. Anywhere from three to six (or eight, with the 'Prophecy of Kings' expansion) of these factions will appear in a game, depending on the number of players. Each faction has unique abilities, home planets, starter units and technologies. Additionally, each faction has distinct characters and themes, and they each specialize in particular areas of the game, such as trade, combat, technology, or politics.
Faction list below:


=== Rounds ===
Play consists of up to 10 rounds (though usually less, depending on how quickly players gain victory points) -- each of which contain several turns. In each round, players choose a strategy card, which provides large bonuses to a particular gameplay mechanic and determines the order in which the players take turns during the round.
Players take turns to perform actions (building units, moving units, using strategy cards, using special action cards). Players are limited in the number of actions they can take during a round by their supply of command tokens, which are divided between strategy (used to access the secondary action of other players' strategy cards), fleet supply (limiting the number of ships that can occupy a system), and command pools (used for tactical actions). Players continue taking actions in turn order until each player has passed.


=== Units and combat ===
Units are purchased throughout the game using the resources from occupied planets. Combat is fought in rounds with each unit rolling one or more 10-sided dice to attempt to score ""hits"" on the enemy player, who is allowed a counter-attack with all their units before choosing which units are destroyed.


=== Politics ===
Politics and discussion play an important role in Twilight Imperium. Agendas are voted on at multiple points throughout the game, with each player's voting power being proportional to the quality and quantity of planets they control. Laws that are successfully passed can greatly modify certain game mechanics and thus change the flow of the game.


=== Scoring ===
At the end of each round, players have the opportunity to score victory points for a public goal that has been revealed and/or for a secret objective assigned to each player at the start of the game. The first player to achieve 10 victory points is declared the new Emperor and wins the game. After the 6th round, the game also has a mechanism where the game has a chance of ending on any subsequent round and the highest scoring player at that point declared the winner.


== Online implementation ==

A community-made implementation of the game was created in Tabletop Simulator. It stems from a fan-version of the third edition game called ""Shattered Ascension"" that was built in Tabletop Simulator in 2011 using the same components but a variant ruleset and gained a significant online community. After the publication of game's fourth edition in 2017, a similar Tabletop Simulator implementation was created in 2018 and is now used for online tournaments.


== Expansions, variants and optional rules ==


=== Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition: Shattered Empire ===
Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion called Shattered Empire in December 2006. It includes two new sets of playing pieces and additional system tiles, expanding maximum player number to eight. It also introduced several rules-fixes to address common criticisms of the base game.


=== Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition: Shards of the Throne ===
Fantasy Flight Games released a second expansion called Shards of the Throne in May 2011, with additions including new factions, technologies, scenarios and units.


=== Variant rulesets ===
The base game and its expansions come with several optional rules and the counters necessary to play them out. The simplest variant is the long game, where the winner must score 14 victory points, rather than 10. However, most variants are intended to allow players to customise the game-play in favour of their preferred mechanics. For example, there are alternative variants of all the strategy cards, which can drastically alter how players organise their turns. Some rule variants introduce new units, whilst others can introduce completely new mechanics, such as race-specific leaders and diplomats, or random encounters for the first player to land on each neutral planet.


=== Twilight Imperium 4th Edition: Prophecy of Kings ===
Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion for 4th Edition Twilight Imperium in November 2020. The expansion contains seven new factions, some of which are based in the lore of Twilight Imperium's previous editions. It also brings in many of the systems and units that were first contained in 3rd edition. A new layer of technologies has been introduced giving more flexibility on how players choose their technology paths. The expansion also includes the Omega updates that were published in April 2020. It does not include any variant rules and is intended to be fully incorporated into the base game.


=== Twilight Imperium 4th Edition: Twilight Codex ===
The Codex is the official web based publication, published by Fantasy Flight Games that highlights rule updates and showcases new content for Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition and eventually the Prophecy of Kings expansion. The predominant figure behind the codex is Dane Beltrami, the head developer of Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition.


== Differences between editions ==


=== Third edition vs previous versions ===
The third edition significantly changed many of the game mechanics. While some of the core elements remained the same, the game as a whole was completely revamped. Here are some of the more significant differences:

In 2E, only the Hacan, Letnev, N'orr, Jol-Nar, Sol, and Xxcha were playable races. The Mentak and Yssaril were introduced in the Hope's End expansion as new playable races. The L1Z1X were present as non-player hostile invaders, introduced to gameplay via some of the events. The Naalu were completely new to the 3rd Edition (although it first appeared in the first edition expansion: The Outer Rim). While the races present in both games kept the same basic flavor and feel, the racial abilities changed between editions.
In 2E, the game rounds were broken into phases: the political, production, movement, invasion, and technology steps. Each player had equal access to these phases every round. In 3E, these phases were largely spread out among the strategy cards, coupled with the new threaded activation sequence.
In 2E, players collected credits as tangible money that could be spent from round to round. 3E's spending is mostly done by exhausting planets, though the trade-good concept does allow some limited form of savable liquid assets.
In 2E, the only spaceships that could be built were cruisers, carriers, dreadnoughts, and fighters. 3E introduced destroyers (cheaper and weaker than cruisers, but more mobile than fighters), and war suns (expensive and powerful super ships).
While most of the technologies were ported from 2E to 3E, many of the effects changed significantly (largely to fit with the 3E sequence better).
Politics in 2E was done at the beginning of each game round by drawing a card from a political card deck, and voting on the agenda. Some of these cards were events which automatically affected the game in some way (such as introducing hostile L1Z1X forces). In 3E, the concept of ""events"" was removed completely.
In 2E, players achieved victory by progressing along a fixed set of objectives, largely centered around the number of resources, influence, and planets controlled, as well as technologies. In 3E, players instead try to achieve victory points by completing objectives revealed during the game; these objectives could change from game to game.
The tiles, cards, and playing pieces in the 3E are noticeably larger in size than their 2E counterparts.


=== Fourth edition vs previous versions ===
Players now have 17 factions available to choose from, including factions that were only available in the expansions for earlier editions such as the Ghosts of Creuss, the Mentak Coalition, the Naalu Collective, and the Yssaril Tribes. The number of factions has been increased to 25 with the Prophecy of Kings expansion and the Twilight Codex Vol. III. 
The phases of play in each round are now strategy, action, status, and the agenda phase. The agenda phase is added only after a player has taken Mecatol Rex.
In the strategy phase, players choose a Strategy Card to use in the upcoming action phase. The strategy cards now control many of the fundamental mechanics that were tied to a phase in the 3rd Edition. As a result, players may be in competition for a particular strategy card, and a taking a particular Strategy Card may be necessary for a player to achieve certain objectives. The Strategy Cards confer abilities such as the purchase of additional command counters, changing who is the Speaker and thus will get first pick of the strategy cards in the next round, refilling commodities for trade, building Planetary Defense Systems (PDS') or Space Docks, researching technology, drawing additional Action Cards or Secret Objectives, or scoring an objective early (in the action phase, while all other players must wait for the status phase).
In the action phase, players take turns expanding their empire by moving ships, building units, engaging in trade and combat, researching technology, making deals, using their Strategic and Action Cards, and attempting to complete the requirements for public and secret objectives. The player's initiative order (the turn order) is determined by a player's lowest number strategy card, e.g. a player with the leadership card (no.1) will go first and a player with the imperial Card (no.8) will go last. The action phase continues until every player has chosen to pass, and once a player has passed they cannot make any more tactical actions. Each strategy card has a primary and a secondary ability - the bearer of a strategy card uses only the primary and the other players may only use the secondary. So that no player ever misses out on the powerful abilities of the strategy cards, the bearer of a strategy card may not pass and end their action phase until they have used their strategy card, and all other players always have the option to use the secondary ability of a strategy card once activated, even if they passed on a previous turn.
The status phase is a book-keeping and maintenance phase. Players score public and secret objectives in the same initiative order from the action phase (not clockwise from the Speaker), reveal the next public objective, draw action cards, remove and regain command tokens (and may redistribute command tokens among their tactical, strategic, and fleet pools), ready all exhausted cards (including the strategy and technology and planetary cards), repair any damaged units, and return the strategy cards to a common play area.
The agenda phase has replaced the politics phase. Once a player has taken Mecatol Rex, it is appended as the fourth phase after the status phase to each round. In the agenda phase, players convene the galactic council on Mecatol Rex and vote on two agendas. Agendas are either Laws (permanent changes to the current game's mechanics, such as allowing all players to build War Suns without needing to research the qualifying technologies) and Directives (a one-time effect such as each player drawing a secret objective, or giving a victory point to the player in last place). Each player casts votes by exhausting their planets for its influence score (where each point of influence is one vote), and may spend as many as they have for the agendas, or abstain from voting. Players may not spend trade goods as influence for casting votes in this phase, but the voting (the active) player is free to offer deals - Promissory Notes, commodities or trade goods - to influence or purchase another player's vote. Players are also allowed to make deals and transactions during the agenda phase whether they share borders or not, allowing for the exchange of promissory notes, and commodities and trade goods. Once both agendas have been voted on, the players refresh all their exhausted planets so they have the resources and influence and technology specialties available for the action phase in the next round.
The technology tree has been simplified. Rather than a confusing flow chart of pre-requisites, technological advancement is through four linear branches, and players can upgrade most of the available units by satisfying pre-requisites in the four branches.
Trade has been simplified. Players now exchange faction commodities which become trade goods when another player acquires them. Instead of requiring trade agreements, the active player is now allowed to trade their commodities with neighbors (anyone they share a border with) during their turn.

The Origins Award is commonly referred to as a Calliope, as the statuette is in the likeness of the muse of the same name. Academy members frequently shorten this name to ""Callie"".


=== Premio JdA ===
This award is for Game of the Year in Spain, ""Premio al Juego de mesa del año"" (Premio JdA), by an independent jury of game industry representatives.


=== Spiel des Jahres ===
These games are winners of the Spiel des Jahres, a German board game award widely considered the most prestigious in the industry.


==== Kennerspiel des Jahres ====
These are winners of Kennerspiel des Jahres, an expansion of the German Spiel des Jahres board game award starting in 2011. It translates to ""connoisseur/expert game of the year"" and is meant for more experienced gamers.


==== Kinderspiel des Jahres ====
The Kinderspiel des Jahres is awarded annually to the best children's game by a jury of German game critics. This award is to children's games what the Spiel des Jahres is to family games.
2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was a subcategory of the Spiel des Jahres awards known as the Sonderpreis ""Kinderspiel"" (""Special Prize for Best Children's Game""). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989–2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres.

Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization,Rewrite history as you build up your civilization in this epic card drafting game!,2015,2,4,3,120,120,14,4.41,Strategy ,,"Age of Empires is a series of historical real-time strategy video games, originally developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios. The first game was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Nine total games within the series have been released so far as of October 28, 2021.
Age of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. Another installment, Age of Empires Online, takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on mythological elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. The fourth main installment in the series, Age of Empires IV, was released on October 28, 2021.
The Age of Empires series has been a commercial success, selling over 25 million copies. Critics have credited part of the success of the series to its historical theme and fair play; the artificial intelligence (AI) players have fewer advantages than in many of the series' competitors.


== Games ==

The games in the series focus on historical events throughout time. Age of Empires covers the events between the Stone Age and the Classical period, in Europe and Asia. Its expansion, The Rise of Rome, follows the formation and rise of the Roman Empire. The Age of Kings and its Nintendo DS spin-off follow Europe and Asia through the Middle Ages. The Age of Kings' expansion pack, The Conquerors, is set during the same period, but also includes scenarios about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, El Cid, and Attila the Hun. Age of Empires III and its first expansion, The WarChiefs, take place during the European colonization of the Americas. Its second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, follows the rise of Asia in the same period. Age of Empires Online focuses on the Greek and Egyptian civilizations. The series' spin-off, Age of Mythology, and its expansion pack, The Titans, are set during the Bronze Age, but focus on mythology as their themes, rather than history.


=== Main series ===


==== Age of Empires ====

Age of Empires, released on October 15, 1997, was the first game in the series, as well as the first major release from Ensemble Studios. It was one of the first history-based real-time strategy games made, utilizing the Genie game engine. GameSpot described it as a mix of Civilization and Warcraft. The game gives players a choice of 12 civilizations to develop from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. The expansion pack, The Rise of Rome, published by Microsoft on October 31, 1998, introduced new features and four new civilizations, including the Romans. Although the two games had contained many software bugs, patches resolved many of the problems.
Age of Empires was generally well received, despite some highly negative reviews. GameSpot criticized a confused design, while Computer and Video Games praised the game as strong in single and multiplayer. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Age of Empires the 1998 ""Computer Strategy Game of the Year"". For several years, the game remained high on the sales charts, with over three million units sold by 2000. The Rise of Rome sold one million units in 2000 and attained 80% as an aggregate score from GameRankings.
In June 2017, Adam Isgreen, creative director of Xbox Game Studios announced Age of Empires: Definitive Edition at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017. It will feature overhauled graphics with support for 4K resolution, a remastered soundtrack, and other gameplay improvements, and was planned to be released on October 19, 2017, but was delayed until February 20, 2018, when it was released on the Microsoft Store. On May 30, 2019, Microsoft announced that the Definitive Edition would be coming to Steam in the future, along with the Definitive Editions of both Age of Empires II and Age of Empires III.


==== Age of Empires II ====

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, released on September 30, 1999, used the Genie game engine, and had gameplay similar to its predecessor. Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages, from the Dark Ages to the Imperial Age. It allows players to choose one of 13 civilizations, from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
On August 24, 2000, Microsoft published the expansion, The Conquerors. It added new units and five new civilizations, including two Mesoamerican civilizations: the Maya and the Aztec. The Age of Kings was a bigger critical success than the first two games, with Game Rankings and Metacritic scores of 92%. Microsoft shipped out more than two million copies to retailers, and the game received numerous awards and accolades. Critics agreed that The Conquerors expanded well on The Age of Kings, though issues of unbalanced gameplay were raised. The Age of Kings and The Conquerors won the 2000 and 2001 ""Computer Strategy Game of the Year"" awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, respectively.
In April 2013, Age of Empires II: HD Edition was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems. The HD Edition includes both the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. Originally a fan-made modpack made for The Conquerors, Age of Empires II: The Forgotten was an unofficial expansion that added a new campaign, playable civilizations, maps, and quality of service updates. The Forgotten was later developed into an official expansion with SkyBox Labs and Forgotten Empires, and in November 2013 The Forgotten HD was released by Microsoft exclusively for the HD Edition on Steam. A third expansion named The African Kingdoms was released by Microsoft in November 2015, also exclusively for the HD Edition. A fourth expansion entitled Rise of the Rajas was released on December 19, 2016. On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition.
In June 2019, Adam Isgreen, now the Franchise Creative Director for Age of Empires, shared more information regarding the Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2019. He confirmed that the Definitive Edition was being developed by Forgotten Empires, Tantalus Media, and Wicked Witch Software. He announced that the game would feature
new 4K graphics, Xbox Live support for multiplayer, exclusive achievements, four new civilizations (Bulgarians, Cumans, Lithuanians, Tatars), three new campaigns, a new spectator mode and tournament features, and additional quality of life improvements. It was released on November 14, 2019. Bert Beeckman, co-founder of Forgotten Empires, confirmed on June 12 that Age of Empires II: HD Edition would not be removed from sale after the release of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition.


==== Age of Empires III ====

Age of Empires III, released on October 18, 2005, was built on an improved version of the Age of Mythology game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and the inclusion of the Havok physics middleware engine. The game is set in the period between 1421 and 1850, and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as home cities. Described by Ensemble Studios as ""an important support system to your efforts in the New World"", home cities help provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They can be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; the feature was compared to a role-playing game character by Ensemble Studios. The first expansion to Age of Empires III, The WarChiefs, was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on Native Americans. Most notable was the introduction of the WarChief unit. The second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, went on sale October 23, 2007. It was a jointly developed product; Big Huge Games helped Ensemble Studios develop the game, with Brian Reynolds joining Bruce Shelley as lead designer. The game expanded the Age of Empires III universe into Asia, and introduced three new civilizations. Reception towards Age of Empires III was mixed; Game Revolution described it as ""about as much fun"" as a history textbook, while GameZone argued it was ""one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that is out on the market currently"". It sold more than two million copies, and won the GameSpy ""real-time strategy game of the year"" award. The WarChiefs failed to equal the success of its predecessor, with a lower score on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, and The Asian Dynasties' score was lower still with 80%.
Several collectors' editions of Age of Empires III included a hardcover artbook. The last page of the artbook has a pictorial depiction of the series; the Roman numerals below each panel range from I to V, indicating the series would include an Age of Empires IV and Age of Empires V. Ensemble Studios employee Sandy Petersen said that the image ""was total speculation on [their] part"".
In 2008, Microsoft announced they were closing down Ensemble Studios following the completion of Halo Wars. Some of its employees would form a new team as part of Microsoft Studios. Kevin Unangst, director of Games for Windows, denied it was the end of the Age of Empires series, telling The San Francisco Chronicle ""we're very excited about the future potential for Age of Empires"". Edge confirmed, in an interview with Microsoft's corporate vice president of interactive entertainment, Shane Kim, that Microsoft continued to own Age of Empires and that they had plans to continue the series. However, Bruce Shelley wrote in his blog that he would not be part of any new studios formed.
Following the announcement of remastered editions of previous games, Microsoft announced Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition on August 21, 2017. On May 30, 2019, the company revealed that the Definitive Edition would come to Steam in the future, along with the Definitive Editions of both Age of Empires and Age of Empires II. On August 28, 2020, Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2020 that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition would release officially on October 15, 2020.
On January 23, 2020, Microsoft announced a closed beta for early February of that year. Betas ran on Steam and the Microsoft Store, with each beta session including a small piece of the game. The first closed beta session began on February 11, 2020, and ended on February 19, 2020. The second closed multiplayer session began on March 31 and ran until April 7. The game was released on October 15, 2020.


==== Age of Empires IV ====

On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires IV, developed by Relic Entertainment. Microsoft's Executive Vice-President of Gaming, Phil Spencer, confirmed on June 11, 2019, that Age of Empires IV was still in development, with more information coming later in 2019. On November 14, 2019, gameplay footage of Age of Empires IV was shown at the X019 event. It showed medieval warfare between English and Mongol forces. Age of Empires IV was officially released on October 28, 2021, with eight civilizations available at launch: the Abbasid Dynasty, the Chinese, the Delhi Sultanate, the English, the French, the Holy Roman Empire, the Mongols, and the Rus. This title revisits the Middle Ages and incorporates several features and mechanics of Age of Empires II that were changed or removed in Age of Empires III.


=== Spin-off games ===

Age of Mythology shared many elements of gameplay with the main series, and was considered a part of the series, despite its different focus. The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with Poseidon. Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002, and its expansion, The Titans, on October 21, 2003. The Titans featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization. Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the titans and frees them from Tartarus. Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.
Backbone Entertainment developed Age of Empires: The Age of Kings as a turn-based game for the Nintendo DS. Majesco Entertainment published the game on February 14, 2006. It is similar to other turn-based games, such as Advance Wars, but with a gameplay based on its PC counterpart. Age of Empires: The Age of Kings scored 80% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. Konami brought a game of the same title to the PlayStation 2 around five years earlier than the DS version, but the game had little promotion, and sold poorly.
On August 16, 2010, Microsoft announced Age of Empires Online, which was a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, it developed in collaboration with Robot Entertainment. It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, as well as more quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.
On April 13, 2014, Age of Empires: World Domination was announced. It was developed by KLab Games for the iOS, Android and Windows Phone. It was released on December 7, 2015, with the service terminated on November 30, 2016.
On August 25, 2014, Age of Empires: Castle Siege was announced. It is a touch-based game developed by Smoking Gun Interactive. It was released on September 17, 2014, for the Windows PC and Windows Phone 8.


== Development ==


=== Historical elements ===
The development phases of the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is ""a good idea for most entertainment products"". Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, ""not [its] designers or researchers"". At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained that the success of the series laid in ""making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer"". Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather ""about the human experience;"" they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as ""going into space"". Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they ""couldn't get away"" with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.


=== Artificial intelligence ===
The artificial intelligence (AI) used in the Age of Empires series has been developed and improved regularly by designers. AI specialist Dave Pottinger noted the development team gave the AI in the original game a very high priority, and spent over a year working on it. He said that the AI in the game relies on tactics and strategies to win, instead of ""cheating"" by giving bonus resources to itself, or tweaking its units to be stronger than normal. Pottinger later noted that the Age of Empires series team took great pride in their AI playing a ""fair game"" and didn't know what the player was doing and had to play by the same rules as its human opponents.
Age of Empires allows players to choose to play either along specialized, story-backed conditions or as individual battles against the AI (and other players). Choosing to battle against the AI – rather than following the storyline – allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies and even remember which games it won and lost. The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games. For instance, in Age of Empires III, this is referred to as playing a ""Skirmish"". However, Age of Empires III allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by ""building a Deck"", which allows players to replace ""Home City"" shipments with improved alternatives.
In Age of Empires II: The Conquerors the AI was given a high priority, the result being the ""smart villager"" feature, which was included in subsequent games of the series. After building a structure that stores or produces resources, smart villagers would proceed to collect resources related to the structure, such as crops from farms or ore from exposed deposits.
Age of Mythology: The Titans lets players use an AI debugger when creating custom scenarios; players can change the settings of computer players and make them act according to certain patterns. More basic changes to the AI had previously been available in the series' first two games.


=== Graphics and visuals ===
The graphics and visuals of Age of Empires improved with each successive release. From the original release to the second, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, noteworthy improvements gained praise from several critics. With the release of Age of Mythology the praise continued, and the fourth release, Age of Empires III, garnered even more.
GameSpot praised the improved graphics in the second release, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Eurogamer welcomed its introduction of female villagers as compared with the original male only version. Allgame praised the advanced grouping and path-finding systems in the second release. Despite the improved graphics, Allgame complained that units in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings were at times difficult to distinguish from one another, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. Nevertheless, Game Revolution wrote that the second release was ""the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now"".
The graphics continued to improve in Age of Mythology and was praised by a majority of reviewers. IGN ranked the graphics in this third release ""a joy to watch ... awesome"". GameSpot assented, also rating the graphics a 9 out of 10. Game Revolution agreed, and PC Gamer stated that the graphics in the third release ""are packed with detail"".
The trend in improved graphics continued well into the next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, ""After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail."" 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as ""one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future"". GameSpy agreed, stating, ""Age III's graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre."" Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about ""the awkward unit behavior"". Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.
GameSpy awarded Age of Empires III the ""Best Graphics"" award at GameSpy's ""Game of the Year 2005"".


=== Music ===
Stephen Rippy has been the series' music director since the first game. He has had occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires with sounds of instruments from the periods in the game. These sounds came from actual instruments, and their digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used. Rippy said that sound development on The Age of Kings was easy, since there was knowledge of the instruments used in the Middle Ages. Therefore, they were able to reproduce the tunes for the soundtrack of the game. In Age of Mythology, an orchestral instrumentation was used, instead. According to McMullan, the team also collected large numbers of audio recordings from zoos, and created ""a massive sound library of [their] own material"". The music of Age of Empires III was similar to The Age of Kings, in which the team used more historical instruments; Rippy noted the team used instruments such as ""bagpipes and field drums"" to give it a realistic feel.


=== Collaboration ===
Ensemble Studios worked together with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires III's second expansion. This was the first joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games did most of the work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.


== Reception and legacy ==

The Age of Empires series has been a commercial success. As of 2008, five of its games have each sold more than one million copies. According to Gamasutra, Age of Empires had sold more than three million copies, and The Rise of Rome sold one million copies as of 2000. Around the same time, Microsoft announced that they shipped over two million copies of The Age of Kings. In 2003, Microsoft announced the sales of one million copies for Age of Mythology. By 2004—prior to the release of Age of Empires III—the Age of Empires franchise had sold over 15 million copies. On May 18, 2007, Ensemble Studios announced that two million copies of Age of Empires III had been sold.
Games in the series have consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the adjacent table, the highest rating game is Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, receiving a 92% score from both sites.
Critics have credited Age of Empires for influencing real-time strategy (RTS) games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, and Cossacks. Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds was also influenced by the series: it utilized the Genie game engine, as Age of Empires and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings had, and was considered by critics to be a very close replica to the games; IGN began their review with the statement ""I love Age of Star Wars, I mean Star Empires. Whatever it's called, I dig it."" and GameSpot wrote that ""fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can jump right in"". In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a GameSpy interview, he explained that parents would ""tell Ensemble Studios that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the triremes so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [the] game taught them what a trebuchet was"".
Shelley has said that the key to the success of the games was its innovation, rather than imitation of its peers. He also claimed the unique elements in the games ""helped establish the reputation of Ensemble Studios as masters of the real-time strategy genre"". Mark Bozon of IGN wrote in his review of The Age of Kings, ""The Age of Empires series has been one of the most innovative real-time strategy games for PC in the last decade or so."" Gamenikki called Ensemble Studios ""the developer that started it all"" when they talked about how much Age of Empires III had done to advance the real-time strategy genre. Shelley has acknowledged the success and innovation of Age of Empires helped to ensure Ensemble survive its early periods since startup. In 2005, Shelley complained of critics holding an ""innovation bias"" against the series; citing the 60% score from Computer Gaming World, he said that despite Age of Empires III being ""perhaps the best selling PC game in the world"" at the time, reviewers expected ""something really new"" and rated it harshly.
Bungie chose Ensemble Studios to develop Halo Wars, an RTS game based on their Halo series. They said that one of the reasons they chose to work with Ensemble was because of the Age of Empires series. They also noted that Ensemble was the perfect choice ""to realize the original vision of Halo"", which started life as an RTS.

Great Western Trail,Use strategic outposts and navigate danger as you herd your cattle to Kansas City.,2016,2,4,3,75,150,12,3.71,Strategy ,,"Great Western Trail is a board game designed by Alexander Pfister for two to four players, which was published in 2017 by Eggertspiele. It is a complex and strategic 'Eurogame', loosely themed on the American frontier and the original Great Western Cattle Trail, in which players engage in the transportation of cattle. A second edition was published in 2021, for one to four players.
The game is also known as 그레이트 웨스턴 트레일 (Korean), Great Western Trail: La Gran Ruta del Oeste (Spanish), A nagy western utazás (Hungarian), グレート ウエスタン トレイル (Japanese), Great Western Trail: Aventură prin Vestul Sălbatic (Romanian), Великий западный путь (Russian).


== Gameplay ==
The gameplay combines ""hand management, action selection, and strategic movement"", with the object being to accumulate victory points, which can be achieved by various means. It takes about 75 to 150 minutes to play.  In addition to the gameboard, each player has a dedicated side board on which are displayed the turn details (top), auxiliary actions (left), the player's certificates (right), and workers (centre). Each player draws a hand of cattle cards and places their herder and train meeples at the starting locations.
Each turn, a player executes the steps as depicted in the turn details area. First, their herder is moved a number of spaces along the game board, up to the maximum indicated. The space on which it lands indicates further actions the player may take, such as erecting buildings on the trail, buying or selling cattle, engaging in trade, or hiring staff. If the player passes over hazards, teepees, or certain buildings owned by opposing players, they must pay a fee in coins. At the end of each turn, the player draws a number of cards from their personal stack to regain their hand limit.

The game progresses as the players advance along the trail toward Kansas City. Upon reaching this destination, five actions are executed: the trading areas are re-stocked, two worker supply areas are filled, the cattle are delivered, and finally, the cattle are loaded onto trains for shipment ""further into the wild west"". Delivery of cattle is accomplished by a player submitting cattle cards in their hands; they receive coins to the value of the sum of the points on the unique cattle cards they have delivered, plus any certificates on their player board that they choose to spend. Shipment of cattle can be made to any city along the track having a value no higher than the value obtained in the delivery phase. The player takes a piece from their board and places it on the selected space. Removal of this piece from the player board enables them to use one of a new action, a larger certificate capacity, greater movement, or larger hand size.
Placing pieces in adjacent cities may earn the player various rewards or penalties including victory points. Cattle cards earn a player a range of victory points, the value printed on each card.
Analysis of the gameplay identifies three broad strategies, depending on the player's principal focus for scoring victory points: collecting and delivering cattle, adding buildings to the board, or advancing their train and upgrading stations. However successful play generally requires some attention to be given to all three areas, and hybrid strategies combining two of these approaches can also be successful.


== Expansions ==
A number of expansions have been released:

Promo Station Master Tiles (2017): Two new stationmaster tiles given away with issue #95 of the French board game magazine Plato Magazine.
The Eleventh Building Tile (2017): A new building tile that was given away as part of the Deutscher Spiele Preis 2017 goodie box.
At the Poker Table (2018): A poker-themed expansion.
Rails to the North (2018): Adds an expanded rail system.
13th Building Tile (2019): Adds a new double-sided building tile.


== Second edition ==
A second edition of the game was published in 2021. It featured new artwork and includes updated game boards made of two layers to prevent components from slipping.  Tile and card backgrounds were updated for better contrast to make it ""easier to distinguish their icons"", and some board colours were made brighter. Rules for a solitaire mode were added based on those created by a fan of the first edition of the game.
The second edition also eliminated ""the notion of Native Americans as the invisible enemy"" by removing teepees as hazards, replacing them with bandits, and adding ethnic and gender diversity to the workers that can be hired.
Further themed editions, based on the same game mechanics but with different artwork and game boards, are planned for 2022 ('Argentina') and 2023 ('New Zealand').


== Reception ==
In a review for Meeple Mountain, Andrew Plassard stated that Great Western Trail is a ""well-designed game with multiple paths to victory"" and lots of variation. He said that one drawback is the ""difficulty of developing a strategy"" given the numerous options available to the player. Tom Mendelsohn, in his review of the game for Ars Technica, states that it is ""an absolute delight"" to play once the players have learned the extensive rules.
Tahsin Shamma, in a review for Board Game Quest, states that Great Western Trail is an amazing, complex game and that a first-time play ""is best with 2 players, but later games are more exciting with 3–4 players"". Shamma also stated that the game's components are utilitarian, but the art and iconography is impressive. He scored the game five out of five, highlighting its strengths as the tactical choices available to players, with play style varying each time according to the initial setup, and its drawbacks being its long playing time at first encounter, and a repetitive style when using only the basic setup. In early 2019, the game was also added to the Board Game Quest ""Shelf of Greatness"". Writing for Tabletop Gaming, Matt Jarvis said that the game ""is a masterful amalgamation of deckbuilding, hand management, tile laying, building management, economic strategy and more"", which ""all comes together to offer an experience that is absolutely top-notch. Complex decisions are made easy to manage thanks to the flawless design and the brilliant theme shines through the gameplay"".
In a review of the second edition of the game for Polygon, Keith Law states that it is his favourite complex game which ""incorporates multiple ideas ... into one coherent package"". He stated that the second edition has new artwork with ""functional as well as aesthetic"" changes from the first edition and that it also includes a solitaire version adapted from a version developed by ""an avid fan of the original"" version.


== Awards ==
The Game has been nominated for numerous awards, and was the 'Meeples' Choice' winner in 2016, Gouden Ludo 'Best Expert Game' and Jogo do Ano winner in 2017, and the UK Games Expo 'best board game (European style)' of 2018.

Great Western Trail (2nd edition)   at BoardGameGeek"
Twilight Struggle,Relive the Cold War and rewrite history in an epic clash between the USA and USSR.,2005,2,2,2,120,180,13,3.59,Strategy,  Wargames,"Twilight Struggle: The Cold War, 1945–1989 is a board game for two players, published by GMT Games in 2005. Players are the United States and Soviet Union contesting each other's influence on the world map by using cards that correspond to historical events. The first game designed by Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews, they intended it to be a quick-playing alternative to more complex card-driven wargames.
It achieved critical acclaim for its well-integrated theme, accessibility and introduction of Eurogame elements. After being voted the number one game on BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016 (eventually dethroned by Pandemic Legacy), it has been called ""the best board game on the planet"". Twilight Struggle is played competitively and was unofficially adapted for play-by-email and live online play. GMT released a Deluxe Edition in 2009, as well as a Collector's Edition as part of the crowdfunding campaign for the game's official adaptation into a video game; this Digital Edition was released in 2016. With over 100,000 copies sold, the game is GMT's all-time best-seller.


== Gameplay overview ==

According to its designers, ""Twilight Struggle basically accepts all of the internal logic of the Cold War as true—even those parts of it that are demonstrably false."" The game board thus presents a map of a bipolar world according to domino theory, where the US and USSR spread influence to all other countries (except China, which is shown as a powerful card, which must be handed to the other player if used, representing China tilting from one bloc to the other), and attempt to establish control depending on the stability of a country. One scholarly analysis proposed that ""[w]hile Twilight Struggle is at its core an area control game, what set its apart from being marked as a Risk clone is the combined effect of material aesthetics and design mechanics meant to embrace a particular point of view tied to the Cold War zeitgeist.""
Gameplay is divided into ten turns. Each turn players randomly draw a hand of event cards from a single deck. The starting deck contains only early war cards, with historically appropriate mid war and late war events shuffled in on turns 4 and 8 (for a total of 103 cards in the first edition). Players both use a card in the turn's headline phase (in which each player must play a card for its event) and six to eight action rounds.


=== Operations and events ===
Cards have operations point values that let a player take one of three actions on the board: to place influence markers in or adjacent to countries where he already has influence; to attempt realignment to remove enemy influence, with bonuses depending on existing influence; or to attempt a coup that can reduce an opponent's influence and increase his own influence in a single country. Realignment and coup attempts partially rely on dice rolls to succeed.
If a card's event is associated with that player, or neutral, the player must choose either to conduct operations or get the beneficial effect of the event. However, if a player conducts operations using a card with an opponent's event, the event occurs as well. For example, the US player can use two operations points from playing the Soviet event ""Fidel"", at the expense of its effect: ""Remove all US Influence in Cuba. USSR gains sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control."" A further option, allowed once per turn, is to expend a card attempting to advance in the Space Race, avoiding triggering that card's event. Strategy requires players to anticipate reactions to what their opponent might play.


=== Scoring and victory ===
Regional scoring cards award victory points to both players based on their respective level of influence—presence, domination or control—in that region when the card is played. The regions have unequal values: domination of Central America is worth three VP but domination of Asia is worth seven. Normally players will hold one card per turn into the next, but scoring cards may not be held.
Player actions are constrained by the DEFCON and required military operations tracks. A coup attempt on one of the battleground countries reduces DEFCON by one each time, restricting the regions where coups and realignments may be attempted. If DEFCON 1 is reached during a player's action round, that player is deemed to have caused a nuclear war and loses immediately. Each turn, however, players will also lose victory points if they do not conduct military operations (coup attempts or playing war events) at least equal to the DEFCON level.
Victory points are gained or lost on a shared one-dimensional track, and a player who reaches 20 VP in his or her favor wins immediately. Control of Europe when its scoring card is played also awards an early victory. If neither player has won by the end of turn 10, a final scoring occurs in which each region is scored once.
According to an analysis of the game's design, ""In some respects, Twilight Struggle resembles a modern-style Eurogame more than a wargame"", in that the game offers multiple paths to score and win. It summarized the game play thus: ""Rules and limited strategic choices governing Event triggers combine to ensure a roughly-accurate historical experience; within this framework of bad and suboptimal choices, one player will eventually squeak out a victory.""


=== Theme ===
Although Twilight Struggle was designed to be simple and playable, it has strongly thematic gameplay – that is, the rules reflect the logic of the Cold War, and the cards refer to actual historical people and events, generally being illustrated with historical photographs. For example, the rule that a player may only add influence to a country where they already have influence or to an adjacent country means that players’ influence moves across borders in a predictable way, simulating domino theory. Meanwhile, the Space Race track includes steps named ""Man in Space"", a reference to Yuri Gagarin, and ""Space Shuttle"". 
Meanwhile, individual cards reference not only major historical happenings, such ""Marshall Plan"", ""Destalinisation"", and ""Captured Nazi Scientists"", which invokes Operation Paperclip, but small-scale ones, such as ""Yuri and Samantha"", based on schoolgirl Samantha Smith's visit to the Soviet Union. Other events reflect the culture of the Cold War, such as ""Voice of America"" and ""Olympic Games"", which allows one player to boycott the Games. A few are metatextual, such as ""How I Learned To Stop Worrying"" and ""Wargames"", both referring to films about the Cold War and even wargames themselves.


== Development ==

Wargaming hobbyists Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta met in 1998 at a board gaming club at George Washington University. They hoped to take advantage of a resurgence in wargaming led by card-driven games, but wanted a quick-playing game to fit their own schedule—more in the vein of We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage than the likes of Paths of Glory. They rejected a Spanish Civil War theme after realizing they did not know enough about the period. Gupta suggested the Cold War theme, which fit well for Matthews, who had studied it extensively when majoring in international relations in the 1980s. According to Matthews, the Cold War had not been depicted in a two-player board game before.
Design drew on many other games. The influence-based scoring system derived from History of the World, and scoring cards from the work of Alan Moon. Using game mechanics to incentivize historical behavior came from experience with For the People. The futility of nuclear war, and its relation to conventional military operations, came from the video game Balance of Power as well as Supremacy. Twilight Struggle takes its title from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address. Early versions were more complex and simulation-like, but through playtesting eventually almost every mechanic was abstracted and the event deck made much smaller: ""Many clever and interesting ideas were discarded as being contrary to the fundamental guiding principles of the game – fast play, simple rules, and getting a lot of gameplay value out of the cards.""
By the summer of 2000, Matthews and Gupta were promoting a prototype at the World Boardgaming Championships. Their first choice of publisher was GMT Games, where Gupta had had a playtesting job. GMT founder Gene Billingsley immediately felt drawn to the theme but had doubts about the game's marketability, and placed it on the company's Project 500 list—it would be published if it achieved 500 preorders. The game ultimately shipped in December 2005 with a retail price of $57.


=== Later editions ===
Matthews subsequently wrote a set of optional rules to simulate the Chinese Civil War, and Volko Ruhnke developed a scenario starting in the late war era. Both were included with the Deluxe Edition in 2009, in addition to new map art, event text revisions and a set of optional cards.
In addition to a Collector's Edition made with luxury materials, potential bonuses with Digital Edition preorders were a set of new cards and the Turn Zero mini-expansion, which adds an earlier starting point and the possibility that historical events such as the 1945 United Kingdom general election, the Battle of Berlin, or the Chinese Civil War happened differently. GMT made a reprint of the new cards and expansion available for general purchase.
In 2022, GMT released Jason Matthews's game Twilight Struggle: Red Sea. Based on the Horn of Africa in the 1970s, especially the deposition of Haile Selassie, it is designed to play similarly to the original game but only take 35 minutes to play. In addition, cards from Twilight Struggle and Red Sea may be used in either game.


== Reception ==
Initial reviews were positive but sales were not as successful. However, when Alan Moon, an influential designer of Eurogames, endorsed the game the first printing sold out quickly. According to one account, ""Twilight Struggle came out the same weekend as the Boardgame Players Association's Winter Activation Meeting ... Though it was not an event on the schedule, Twilight Struggle was the talk of the show ... At PrezCon a month later, the dealer sold out in the first few minutes he was open.""
Jon Waddington for Gamers Alliance Report was positive but noted problems with unclear card and rule book texts (in the first edition). ""I cannot quite give Twilight Struggle an unqualified recommendation, and yet I consider it one of the best games I've played in the last few years."" Rating the game 93%, Armchair General reviewer Kaarin Engelmann pointed out that ""One of its strengths is that few other games deal with the subject, yet it is not important to remember pre-Glasnost years to enjoy the game."" Game designer Zev Shlasinger commented: ""Twilight Struggle gives you a compact history lesson about the Cold War ... Coupled with that is the game's accessibility and the design's cleverness, all of which make Twilight Struggle stand out among the crowd of recent political wargame releases.""
Users voted Twilight Struggle the highest-ranked game on BoardGameGeek from December 2010 until it was unseated by Pandemic Legacy in January 2016. This led later commentators like FiveThirtyEight's Oliver Roeder to call it ""the best board game on the planet""; Vice Motherboard's Michael Gaynor called it ""the best board game ever created"". It became GMT Games' all-time best-seller, with lifetime sales of approximately 100,000 copies as of July 2016.


=== Awards ===

== Influence ==
Jason Matthews reused mechanics of Twilight Struggle in several games. For example, in 1960: The Making of the President, the countries are replaced by states, and victory points are replaced by electoral votes deciding the 1960 United States presidential election. Similar adaptations are Campaign Manager 2008, 1989: Dawn of Freedom and Founding Fathers. Volko Ruhnke used it as the ""starting point"" for the mechanics of Labyrinth: ""What would Twilight Struggle look like if it were covering 2004 to 2009?""
Matthews and Gupta next collaborated on Imperial Struggle: The Global Rivalry Between Britain and France, 1697–1789. Gupta characterized Twilight Struggle as an ""older cousin"" to Imperial Struggle.


== Online play ==
Following a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, Twilight Struggle Digital Edition was released in 2016. Developed by Playdek and published by Asmodee Digital, this paid version allows play against a computer in addition to another player. It was released for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android; the campaign had also promised a Linux edition.
Before 2016, it was available in Wargamesroom for PC.
Other alternatives, allowed by GMT games only if at least one player owns the board game are:

Saito (available in English and Chinese)
F14 (available only in Chinese)
Automated Card Tracking System (for play-by-email) complemented with:
Cyberboard Gamebox
Module for the open-source Vassal Engine
TwiStrug virtual board.


== Competitions ==
Twilight Struggle has been played in different online and live tournaments since 2005. Currently, among the most relevant active tournaments, the following stand out:

International league (hybrid: online and face-to-face): ITSL
International online leagues: OTSL and RTSL
Asynchronous international leagues: RATS and BPA Tournament
National leagues: KTSL, LFTS, French League, UK League, Greek League, LPTS, Nordic League and various regional American leagues.
On-site championships: TS Convention, WBC Tournament
2-Day Online Tournaments: Online World Cup, Mind Sports Olympiad, Grand Slams
Team Tournaments: Nations Cup and US Cup
Most of these championships count their results within a unified rating (ITS Rating), allowing to know in advance the level of each player and thus being able to balance the schedules in an optimal way. Some of the competitions are broadcast live with commentators in specialized channels like ActionRoundZero or Caecius.
The original rule book included the tournament rule of revealing held cards at the end of a turn, to prevent cheating by holding a scoring card. In more modern competitions this was replaced by showing the bottom of the card, demonstrating that it is not a scoring card.
The Deluxe Edition rule book includes an annotated ""Extended Example of Play"" taken from a Boardgame Players Association play-by-email tournament. The Collector's Edition rule book provides for tournament players to bid starting influence on their preferred side. In most of the current competitions, +2 influence points for USA and option cards are used as standard, obtaining a balance very close to 50% between both sides.
The original rules allow for a tie, although in the Playdek application in case of a tie in Final Scoring the victory is given to the American player and in case of a tie through Wargames the victory is given to the player who did not event the card. Most of today's competitions follow the original rules and therefore allow for ties.


=== ITSL ===
ITSL (International Twilight Struggle League) is the oldest active tournament in Twilight Struggle, since 2006, including most important Twilight Struggle players. Jason Matthews himself played in the first edition.


=== Nations Cup ===
The Nations Cup is played by national teams who take decisions by consensus. The competition starts with a Qualifying Stage, after which the strongest teams play in the Final Stage.

Scythe ,"Five factions vie for dominance in a war-torn, mech-filled, dieselpunk 1920s Europe.",2016,1,5,4,90,115,14,3.43,Strategy ,,"Scythe is a board game for one to five players designed by Jamey Stegmaier and published by Stonemaier Games in 2016. Set in an alternative history version of 1920s Europe, players control factions that produce resources, develop economic infrastructure, and use dieselpunk combat mechs to engage in combat and control territories. Players take up to two actions per turn using individual player boards, and the game proceeds until one player has earned six achievements. At this point, the players receive coins for the achievements they have attained and the territories they control, and the player with the most coins is declared the winner.
Stonemaier Games crowdfunded the development of Scythe, raising over $1.8 million through a Kickstarter campaign. Scythe was released to critical and commercial praise for its gameplay, combination of Eurogame and combat mechanics, theme, and the game artwork, which was produced by Polish painter Jakub Różalski under the name World of 1920+. Three major expansions, a spin-off, and a digital version have been released for the game.


== Gameplay ==

Scythe takes place in an alternative history version of 1920s Europe that is recovering from the effects of the great war. Players represent different factions seeking their fortune in the redeveloping landscape. Players build an economic engine by selecting one of four main actions each turn. Each action is listed on the top of a personal player board, and players cannot take the same action in consecutive turns. They may also take a corresponding second action as listed on their player board. Actions allow players to move units on the board, trade for or produce goods, bolster their military for combat, deploy mechs, enlist recruits for continuous bonuses or build structures. The actions themselves may also be upgraded, making them either less costly to enact or stronger when deployed.
Each player is given six stars, which are placed onto the board when they complete specific goals, such as deploying all four of their mechs. The game immediately ends when one player has placed 6 stars. Players then tally the money that they receive from achievements earned, territory controlled, and gathered resources based on their in-game popularity achieved; the player who finishes the game with the most money wins.


== Development and release ==
Scythe was designed by Jamey Stegmaier, the CEO of Stonemaier Games, and was revealed as a Kickstarter campaign on October 13, 2015. Backers contributed over $1.8 million to the campaign. Physical copies of the game were delivered to backers in July 2016; it was later released in Gen Con and other retail stores the following month.
Approximately 130 alternate history artworks were illustrated by the Polish artist Jakub Różalski. The game's theme is set in the 1920+ alternate history universe, which was inspired by the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921, and also later used in Iron Harvest. The plot focuses on the conflict between several nations in Central and Eastern Europe that occurred in the aftermath of World War I. The factions are Polania, Rusviet, Saxony, Crimea, Nordic (based on Poland, Soviet Russia, Imperial Germany, Crimean Khanate, and Scandinavia, respectively). The video gaming website Polygon also stated that the artwork also was ""the inspiration for dozens of objective and narrative cards"". 
During playtesting, Stegmaier asked players to quantitatively rate the game with a maximum score of ten, and described that ""when I start to see those ratings creep over 8, I know we’re getting really close"". Scythe also includes the Automa, a solo-player mode designed by Morten Monrad Pedersen, who also contributed to other Stonemaier Games products including Wingspan and Viticulture. He stated the difficulty in designing one-player games was for the Automas to resemble human players while being streamlined, which required ""a purging of unnecessary mechanics"" to reduce the downtime.


=== Expansions ===
Scythe has received three major expansions and several promotional packages. The first expansion, Scythe: Invaders from Afar, was released in 2016. It added new player mats and two new factions into the game, increasing the player count from five to seven. The new factions are Albion and Togawa (based on United Kingdom and Japan, respectively). The second expansion, Scythe: The Wind Gambit, was released in 2017, featuring airships and adding variable end-game conditions to the base game. The Wind Gambit was met with praise for its new victory conditions and components, but the airships were critiqued for providing only limited appeal as the game progressed. In 2017, The Wind Gambit won the Golden Geek Award for Best Game Expansion.
Scythe: The Rise of Fenris was published in 2018 as the third expansion of Scythe. It introduced 11 modules, featuring an eight-episode campaign, two factions (Fenris and Vesna), a cooperative mode, and a multiplayer Automa variant. The Rise of Fenris was met with positive reviews, winning the 2018 Golden Geek Award for Best Game Expansion. Hall praised the storyline, art, and enhancements to replayability provided by the expansion, while Williams described each module as ""mind-blowing"" and the campaign as ""flavorful, exciting, memorable and, most importantly, extremely fun"".
Outside of traditional expansions, Stonemaier Games has released several promotional packages for Scythe. Scythe Encounters, published in December 2018, included a set of 32 promotional encounter cards designed primarily from fan submissions. Scythe Modular Board, which alters the in-game map, was released in July 2019. In late 2020, Scythe Complete Rulebook was released. It was compiled by Matt Griepp and Brittany Griepp, and combined rulebooks for the base game and expansions.


=== Alternate versions ===
In 2017, Stonemaier Games published a stand-alone spin-off to Scythe. Titled My Little Scythe, the game was initially a fan project that was later developed into a print and play designed by Hoby and Vienna Chou, which received the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Print and Play game. The game was inspired by Scythe and featured similar mechanisms, but was re-themed and simplified for a more casual, family-friendly experience. Initially, the designer wanted to incorporate the My Little Pony franchise, although due to problems with licensing, the board game is not directly connected to that franchise. An expansion adding two new factions and airships, titled My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky, was released in June 2020.
In a Techraptor review, Travis Williams praised the game’s accessibility, engagement, mechanics, playtime, and components. This sentiment was echoed by Polygon, which also praised the game's accessibility and mechanics. Michał Szewczyk from Rebel Times concluded that the game is a well-executed if simplified version of Scythe, bridging the world of serious board games and family games. 
In 2018, Scythe: Digital Edition, a video game, was released by Asmodee Digital as a digital adaptation of Scythe. The game was released on 5 September 2018 on Steam for PC, including both Mac and Windows. In 2020, a mobile version was subsequently released and available to download on iOS and Android. Iron Harvest, a real-time strategy game inspired by Scythe's 1920s setting, was also released in September 2020, and was positively received for its artwork and thematic setting.


== Reception ==
Scythe was released to acclaim from board game critics, who praised its mechanism, gameplay, and art. It was listed as one of the best games of 2016 by several reviewers, including William Herkewitz from Popular Mechanics, Aaron Zimmerman from Ars Technica, Tomasz Sokoluk from Rebel Times, and Peter Jenkinson from the Telegraph. The reviewer Aaron Zimmerman described it as a ""deep, puzzly, interactive Euro-style board game"". Zimmerman also praised the complementary nature of the simple turn structure and the ""many complex, interlocking parts"" of the engine building mechanics. This sentiment was echoed by Matt Jarvis from Tabletop Gaming, who praised the game's balance of depth and accessibility, the ""cleverly designed"" player mats, and as the encounter mechanism, which he believed ""round[s] out Scythe's in-game universe and offer[s] a more micro-level human edge"". Several years after its release, Scythe appeared on a list from The Wirecutter of the best board games. The reviewers praised the game's ""immense strategic depth"" and ""beautiful, steampunk-meets-pastoral idyll world-building aesthetic"".
Reviewers particularly highlighted Scythe's use of Eurogame-style resource management and combat mechanics found in American-style board games. Zimmerman compared the simplicity of combat to the systems in Kemet and Dune, describing it as a ""tense exercise"", but also noted the relative infrequency of combat within the game world. Jarvis praised the ""quick and highly strategic"" combat system but found that resource production was instrumental for victory. Luke Plunkett from Kotaku also observed that resource management and construction were more significant for in-game success than combat. Różalski's artwork also received significant praise from reviewers, with Charlie Hall of Polygon acknowledging the game's use of artwork as a thematic core for objective and encounter cards and stating that each card ""is a treasure"". PC Gamer editor Jonathan Bolding also commended the art quality, noting that ""[t]he cards have fascinating scenes of agrarian life juxtaposed with smoking dieselpunk mechs and war machines"". Reviewing for the Dicebreaker, Alex Meehan praised the artwork displaying both the war setting and its ""consequences on the ordinary people"". She concluded that it was ""a huge draw for players looking for a game with an arresting setting"". Sokoluk also stated that the most distinctive element of the game is Różalski's art style, which has helped to create hype for the game even before its debut. Zimmerman was additionally complimentary, writing that the game is ""tied together through the stunning art"". 
The single-player artificial opponent, the Automa, was also well-received. Plunkett praised the functionality of the Automa as ""a great way to learn the ropes before getting a crew together"", but noted that there were major differences between the game's single- and multiplayer modes. Travis Williams from TechRaptor agreed, saying that the Automa was ""slickly designed"" and praising its suitability as a non-player faction in multiplayer games.

Scythe received four Golden Geek Awards from BoardGameGeek in 2016, for Board Game of the Year, Artwork & Presentation, Strategy Game, and Solo Game, while also placing as a runner-up for Most Innovative. The game was also well received commercially: as of April 2021, Stonemaier Games had sold over 382,000 copies. Scythe had the highest sales of any Stonemaier Game until 2021, when it was surpassed by Wingspan. 
Upon its release, Scythe: Digital Edition received mostly positive reviews upon its release on Steam. Calvin Wong Tze Loon from PC Gamer commended the ""slick tutorial"", the mechanisms, visuals and the soundtrack; concluding that it was ""evocative, clever, and rewarding"". Keith Law from Ars Technica also praised the visuals of the adaptation and engagement but criticised the price of 20 dollars and complexity of the tutorial. In a mixed review, CD-Action noted the game's similarity with the original board game, stating that ""Its biggest merit in the eyes of purists is arguably also its biggest flaw – Scythe: Digital Edition offers nothing that the original board game wouldn't"".

7 Wonders Duel,Science? Military? What will you draft to win this head-to-head version of 7 Wonders?,2015,2,2,2,30,30,10,2.22,Strategy ,,"7 Wonders is a board game created by Antoine Bauza in 2010 and originally published by Repos Production (part of Asmodee Group). Three decks of cards featuring images of historical civilizations, armed conflicts, and commercial activity are used in the card drafting game 7 Wonders. The game received critical success upon its release, and won numerous awards, including the inaugural Kennerspiel des Jahres connoisseurs' award in 2011.


== Gameplay ==
7 Wonders is a dedicated deck card game that features ancient civilizations. At the start of the game, each player randomly receives a gameboard called a ""Wonder board"". Each board depicts one of Antipater of Sidon's original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Players place cards representing various materials and structures around their Wonder boards. The boards are double-sided; the wonders on side A are generally easier to build, while those on side B grant more interesting benefits.
7 Wonders is played over three ages totalling 18 turns, known in the game as Ages I, II, and III, each using its own decks of cards. In each age, seven cards are randomly dealt to each player. The game uses a card-drafting mechanic in which, once per turn, each player selects a card to play from his or her hand, then passes the remaining cards (face-down) to the next player. This process is repeated until five out of the seven cards have been played. At this point, each player must choose to play one of his remaining two cards and discard the other.
Each age card represents a structure, and playing a card is referred to as building a structure. To build a structure, a player must first pay the construction cost, in coins or in one or more of the seven resource types, then lay it down by his or her Wonder board. A player lacking the resources available may pay his direct neighbors to use their resources, normally at two coins per resource, if available.
Some cards also belong to free construction chains. Cards played in previous ages can allow players to construct cards in ages 2 and 3 for free. For example, many of the science cards allow players to build several age 2 and 3 structures for free.
Instead of building a structure, a player may choose either to discard an Age card to earn three coins from the bank or to use the card to build a stage of his or her wonder. The Wonder boards have from two to four stages, shown at the bottom of the board. To build a wonder stage, a player must pay the resource cost listed on the stage, then put an age card underneath the wonder board in the appropriate place.
There are seven types of Age cards, representing different types of structures, which are determined by the color of their background:

Brown cards (raw materials) provide one or two of the four raw material resources used in the game (wood, ore, clay brick, and stone).
Grey cards (manufactured goods) provide one of the three manufactured goods used in the game (glass, papyrus, and textiles).
Red cards (military structures) contain ""shield"" symbols; these are added together to give a player's military strength, which is used in conflict resolution at the end of each age.
Blue cards (civic structures [mistranslated as ""civilian"" in the game rules]): all grant a fixed number of victory points.
Yellow cards (commercial structures) have several effects: they can grant coins, resources, and/or victory points or decrease the cost of buying resources from neighbors.
Green cards (scientific structures): each card has one of three symbols. Combinations of the symbols are worth victory points.
Purple cards (guilds) generally grant victory points based on the structures a player and/or his neighbors have built.
Brown and grey cards only appear in the Age I and II decks; purple cards only appear in the Age III deck.
At the end of each age, military conflicts are resolved between neighbors. This is done by comparing the number of shield symbols on the players' red cards, and awarding victory points accordingly. Once all three decks have been played, players tally their scores in all the different developed areas (civil, scientific, commercial, etc.). The player with the most victory points wins.
In the base game, there are seven means of obtaining victory points:

Military victories – one point for each victory (having the most shields) during the first age, 3 for the second age, and 5 for the third age. Each defeat makes a player lose 1 victory point regardless of the age.
Gold coins – one point for every 3 coins a player possesses at the end of the game.
Wonder stages – many of the wonder stages grant a fixed number of victory points.
Civic structures (blue cards) – each structure grants a fixed number of victory points.
Commercial structures (yellow cards) – Age III commercial structures grant victory points based on certain structures a player has built.
Guilds (purple cards) – the guilds provide several means of gaining victory points, most of which are based on the types of structure a player and/or his/her neighbors have built.
Scientific structures (green cards) – each green card has a symbol on it – tablet, compass, or gear. One card of a type grants one victory point, but two cards grant four; the number of points granted is equal to the number of symbols possessed squared. Additionally, each set of tablet, compass, and gear possessed is worth 7 points.


== Expansions ==


=== 7 Wonders: Leaders (2011) ===
This expansion introduces the white-backed leader cards, which can be recruited to aid a player's city. The 36 leader cards are based on real historical figures or legends: Amytis, Alexander, Archimedes, Aristotle, Bilkis, Caesar, Cleopatra, Croesus, Euclid, Hammurabi, Hannibal, Hatshepsut, Hiram, Hypatia, Imhotep, Justinian, Leonidas, Maecenas, Midas, Nebuchadnezzar, Nefertiti, Nero, Pericles, Phidias, Plato, Praxiteles, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, Ramesses, Sappho, Solomon, Tomyris, Varro, Vitruvius, Xenophon, and Zenobia. A brief biography of each leader is featured in the rulebook.
Playing with the Leaders expansion changes the game mechanic, as the second thing done in the game after choosing a Wonder board is to choose leaders. Four leader cards are dealt to each player, and the cards are drafted. At the start of each Age, players may recruit one leader, paying its coin cost and putting it into play. To compensate for this extra expense, with the Leaders expansion, players start with six coins instead of three. As with the Age cards, instead of recruiting a leader, a player may choose to discard the card to gain three coins or build a Wonder stage with it.
The leaders grant various abilities, including additional means of gaining victory points, resources, or coins, resource cost reductions, commerce benefits, additional shields, and scientific symbols. For example, the ""Caesar"" card grants two shields and ""Midas"" grants one extra victory point per three coins held at the end of the game.
The expansion comes with four additional guild cards and one extra Wonder board – the Colosseum of Rome, which grants abilities related to the new leader cards.


=== 7 Wonders: Cities (August 2012) ===
The Cities expansion introduces nine city cards (with a black background) to each of the Age card decks. The number of city cards that are shuffled into each age's deck is equal to the number of players. This means that each age now consists of seven play of cards.
The city cards can have quite an impact on gameplay, as many of them are more powerful but expensive versions of existing cards; for example, the Age III ""Contingent"" card provides five shields as opposed to the three provided by Age III red cards. The cards also introduce some new concepts such as diplomacy, which allows a player to avoid military conflict for one Age, and monetary loss, which forces the player's opponents to either pay coins to the bank or lose victory points if they cannot or will not pay.
The addition of city cards takes the total number of cards playable in each age to 56. This means that eight-player games – or team games with four teams of two – are possible. In the team game, partners are allowed to see each other's cards and discuss which ones to play, and the effect of diplomacy is modified.
The Cities expansion also contains three new guild cards, six leader cards (Aspasia, Berenice, Caligula, Darius, Diocletian, Semiramis), and two Wonder boards (the Hagia Sophia of Byzantium and Al Khazneh of Petra). Many of these new additions have abilities specific to city cards or to the new concepts introduced.


=== 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (May 2013) ===
This expansion adds four Wonder boards: Abu Simbel, the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge, and the Manneken Pis of Brussels (the hometown of the game's creators).


=== 7 Wonders: Babel (December 2014) ===
Babel consists of two expansions that can be added separately or together. The first expansion is Tower of Babel, in which players can choose to construct the tower. By discarding a card, players can place a tile on the tower that affects play (for example, taxing the construction of Wonders or granting a monetary bonus for building certain cards) until it is covered by a subsequent tile. Players score points for the number of tiles they play. The second expansion is Great Projects of Babel. A building of a certain color is put into play. Whenever a player plays a card of the same color, they may choose to pay a cost to participate in the building of the Great Project. If the project succeeds, all players who participated get a reward, and non-participants get nothing. If the project fails, participants get nothing and non-participants receive a penalty.


=== 7 Wonders: Leaders Anniversary Pack & Cities Anniversary Pack (2017) ===
These expansions add new Leaders cards and new Cities cards, with new effects. The new Leaders are all powerful women of history: Aganice, Agrippina, Arsinoe, Cornelia, Cynisca, Enheduanna, Eurypyle, Gorgo, Makeda, Nitocris, Octavia, Phryne, Roxana, Telesilla, and Theano.


=== 7 Wonders: Armada (October 2018) ===
Armada adds a naval board for each player and four ships: red, blue, yellow, and green. When playing a card of one of these colors, players may pay an additional cost to advance the corresponding ship along the board. Advancing each ship grants different bonuses: the red ship grants naval strength, which is compared to all players at the end of the Age, not just neighbors; the yellow ship grants money; the blue ship grants victory points; and the green ship allows players to discover islands, which grant extra bonuses.


=== 7 Wonders Second Edition (2020) ===
The second edition of 7 Wonders was released in 2020. The graphics, wonders in the base game, and cards cost and chains were slightly modified. Most notably in the base game, the Strategists' Guild was replaced by the Decorator's Guild, which grants 7 points if all of a player's wonder steps are built by the end of the game. Olympia and Babylon received the biggest changes in terms of abilities. Leaders, Cities, and Armada also received changes in the second edition in terms of graphics and abilities.


== Spin-offs ==


=== 7 Wonders: Duel (October 2015) ===
7 Wonders: Duel is a two player version of 7 Wonders in which players alternate drafting from an overlapping pyramid of cards. A version of the game for iOS and Android was released by Repos Digital in 2019. An Ars Technica review stated that ""[the] game's three win conditions—civilian, scientific, and military—ensure that you're always juggling several plates, and the whole thing plays like a lightning-quick, board-less match of Civilization"". The game also appeared on a New York Times list, with the reviewers praising its multiple ways of victory, the game arc, complexity, replayability, and strategy, but was criticised for its difficult learning curve. Dicebreaker also considered it to be one of the best card drafting games. IGN considered it to be superior to the original, and was complimentary to the new draft system.


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – Pantheon (October 2016) ===
The expansion to 7 Wonders: Duel added new abilities to the game via a rotating pantheon of gods, as well as two new wonders.


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – Agora (January 2021) ===
Adds a Senate with new play mechanics based on new senator and ""conspirator"" cards. The expansion includes two new tokens and two new Wonders based on this while introducing a new ""political victory"".


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – promotional wonders ===
Messe Essen (2015)
Statue of Liberty (2016)
Stonehenge (2017)
Sagrada Familia (2018)


=== 7 Wonders: Architects (2021) ===
A whole new game based on multiple decks and wonders of different bits and pieces which the players construct. The publishers stated that it was more family-friendly than its predecessor but still deep enough for ""gamers"" to enjoy. The game was recommended for the 2022 Spiel des Jahres.


== Reception ==

The game is highly regarded, and has won more than 30 gaming awards, including the inaugural Kennerspiel des Jahres connoisseurs' award in November 2011. The program with a tonne of features geared towards everyone from the beginner wishing to learn the fundamentals to the experienced wood pusher who might need practice for tournament play. The game has been cited by leading designers as one of the most influential board games of the last decade, with Polygon praising its originality. It was also the winner of the 2011 Vuoden Aikuistenpeli (Finland) for Adult game of the year.

=== Companion game ===
Embers of Memory, a two-person card game based on the Throne of Glass book series, was released in October 2019 by Osprey Games. It is set during the events of the final book in the series, Kingdom of Ash. The players are tasked with helping Aelin survive her imprisonment and ordeal at the hands of Maeve, diving with her into her memories and helping her find the way back out.


== Characters ==


=== Main ===
Aelin Ashryver Whitethorn Galathynius, also known as Celaena Sardothien, is the main protagonist of the series. When she was young, her parents were murdered and she was found near-dead by Arobynn Hamel. Trained from childhood to become an assassin, she earned a reputation as the greatest in the world. However, she was betrayed and imprisoned by her master in the salt mines of Endovier. One year later, Celaena is offered an opportunity to participate in a competition to become the King's Champion. If she wins, she must remain in the King of Adarlan's service for 4 years and will then be granted her freedom and full pardon. In the following books it is revealed that she is the lost Princess of Terrasen. Her lineage makes her key in saving Adarlan from the Valg and grants her immense magical power. While serving the King of Adarlan, she is sent to Wendlyn where she meets her mate, Rowan Whitethorn. She is described as talented, clever, arrogant, beautiful and possessing striking physical features.
Rowan Whitethorn Galathynius: A full-blooded Fae who is over three centuries old. He has silver hair and pine-green eyes, can take the form of a white-tailed hawk, and has the powers of cryokinesis and wind manipulation. A few hundred years prior to the events of Throne of Glass, his wife, Lyria, and their unborn child were killed. He was tasked with training Aelin when she came to see Maeve, Queen of Doranelle. He and Aelin eventually fall in love and marry, and were revealed to have been mates, even though Maeve had tricked Rowan into believing Lyria was his mate.
Dorian Havilliard II, is known as the Crown Prince of Adarlan. Havilliard chooses to sponsor Celaena as his contender for the competition to become his father's champion. He tries at times to stand up to his father, but he is never fully able to defy him. His best friend is the Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall. He is adept at solving problems and will search for the answers to questions even if no one else can or will help. He also possesses a great deal of loyalty, as he goes out of his way and endangers himself to protect his friends. Dorian is tall and lean, with raven-black hair with his eyes being sapphire blue. Dorian has inherited raw magic with the goal to hide it from his father. Two of his main magic abilities are being able to use ice and magic hands. Dorian later falls in love with the witch Manon, heir to the Blackbeak clan.
Manon Blackbeak Crochan: Manon is a witch and heir to the Blackbeak clan. She belongs to an Ironteeth clan making up the heavily martial faction of witches known as the Ironteeth. Her grandmother is the Blackbeak Matron. Her coven is known as the Thirteen, the fiercest coven in the Ironteeth witches. She went to Morath to train in fighting with wyverns, along with many other witches, where she develops a strong bond with her wyvern, Abraxos. She is revealed to be the last Crochan Queen, and is the key to unlocking the curse on the witches' homeland, as she was born of both Crochan and Ironteeth blood. Initially allying with Adarlan, her alliances change in Empire of Storms, as she decides to unite the witches and fight the demons.
Chaol Westfall: He is the Captain of the Guard, and is very wary of Celaena throughout the first and part of the second book, as he recognizes the threat she poses to the kingdom. He is very close to Dorian and is willing to sacrifice his life for him. Throughout the first book, Chaol helps Celaena get back into shape during the tournament, training diligently with her every morning. In the second book, he enters into a love affair with Celaena. This affair ends after the murder of Nehemia, which Celaena blames Chaol for, because Chaol did not warn Celaena about the threats against Nehemia's life. By the end of the series, they have rekindled their friendship, and Chaol has a new love, Yrene, a healer who cures the paralysis in his legs. Chaol has been described to have a friendly relationship with his underlings. He is loyal and honest, even if his loyalty can come in conflict with his morals.
Elide Lochan: She is a cousin of Aelin and bears Blackbeak blood in her. She had been imprisoned by her uncle in a tower since she was eight, causing her to lose the ability to read, and also suffers a terrible leg injury. Later when her uncle takes her to Morath as a servant, she befriends Manon and makes her escape with the help of another character called Kaltain. On the way to find Celaena Sarthodien and Aelin, not knowing the two are the same, she meets Lorcan - a fae with powers gifted by Hellas himself, and the two soon falls in love. Most parts of the Empire of Storms is in her perspective. She is an important character whose only powers are her smartness and cunning. She has caught the attention of Anneith - a healing goddess, who occasionally whispers in her ear and guides her. Elide has a pale, triangular face, onyx eyes, and long, thick midnight-black hair and is daring and courageous. She is able to regain her title as Lady of Perranth once her uncle dies and serves in Aelin's court.


=== Recurring ===
Princess Nehemia Ytger: She is a princess of the kingdom of Eyllwe. Nehemia has chosen to ally with Adarlan so its people won't be killed, but secretly resists them. She pretends that she can only speak in her native tongue and acts like she doesn't understand what people say when they are speaking. In the first book, she has Celaena teach her how to speak the common Adarlanian language. She is a very strong-willed person and refuses to be looked down upon. Her main weapon is a staff that the people from her kingdom produce. She can communicate with Celaena because Celaena can speak in Nehemia's language. Nehemia eventually manipulates an acquaintance into killing her to motivate Celaena to free Terrasen, Eyllwe, and other countries from Adarlan.
Aedion Ashryver  also known as Wolf of the North by commoners: Aelin's cousin, demi-fae with enhanced senses but no magic. Aedion has Aelin's snarky, sarcastic attitude and her self-confidence. He is unfailingly loyal, and willing to die for his queen. Aedion is pansexual, revealing to Lysandra that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. Aedion is 6'3"", heavily muscled, has a tanned complexion, long, golden blond hair, and his family's turquoise eyes ringed with gold.
Kaltain Rompier: Kaltain is a young lady who comes from a fairly rich family. She comes to the palace as the guest of Duke Perrington so she can get close to Dorian and marry him. She is willing to do anything to become Dorian's bride and to be in a position of power. She is imprisoned by Perrington and given to a Valg prince, whom she secretly destroys. She has a rare form of magic called shadowfire. Later in the series, she gives Elide Lochan a Wyrdkey, then destroys herself along with a part of Morath.
The King of Adarlan/Dorian Havilliard I: Dorian Havilliard the First is the initially unnamed father and ruler of the Adarlanian Empire. He is the current monarch of the Empire and Head of House Havilliard. By his wife, Georgina, he fathered Dorian II and Hollin Havilliard. The King was described as having no resemblance to his son Dorian; he had a broad frame with a round face and craggy features, and sharp eyes, with one of his eyebrows scarred. When the King was younger and before the Valg had taken him over, he was much like his son Dorian. However, he was possessed by a Valg demon when he was young, making him tyrannical and sociopathic. Under the Valg's control, the King became a ruler who took great pleasure in exerting his will over others. He did not appear to care about anything other than himself and gaining more power.
Lysandra: A former courtesan who worked with Arobynn Hamel. The earliest depiction we see of Lysandra is a spoiled girl who always gets what she wants, along with frequently getting in the way of her 'nemesis,' Celaena Sardothien. As the series progresses, however, she displays a sharp mind, courage, and kindness. She takes a small girl named Evangeline under her wing, which causes Aelin to begin to trust her again. Throughout the series, Lysandra proves herself to be a loyal and courageous member of the new court of Terrasen. She is fiercely loyal and very dedicated to creating a better world for Evangeline. Lysandra can shapeshift into any animal or human that she wills, however prefers her ghost leopard and wyvern forms. Lysandra is introduced as a stunningly beautiful, curvy woman with dark brown hair reaching down her shoulders and back, pale skin, emerald eyes and full lips. This is not her original form, however, and took it before magic vanished because it was advantageous.


== Development ==


=== Background ===
Sarah J. Maas has cited Disney's Cinderella as an inspiration for writing Throne of Glass. While viewing the scene in which the heroine flees the ball, Maas found the soundtrack ""way too dark and intense"". This led her to re-imagine a number of details. ""The music fit much better when I imagined a thief—no, an assassin!—fleeing the palace,"" she said. ""But who was she? Who had sent her to kill the prince? Who might the prince's enemies be? A powerful, corrupt empire, perhaps?""
Originally known as Queen of Glass, the story initially appeared on FictionPress.com. Bloomsbury acquired the novel in 2010, and purchased two additional Throne of Glass novels in 2012. Publicist Emma Bradshaw noted Maas' ""huge online following, particularly in the US"". Additionally, Throne of Glass became the first Bloomsbury children's novel to be featured on Netgalley.com, attracting requests ""from all over the world.""
Following its acquisition by Bloomsbury, the story went through a number of revisions prior to publication. Regarding the tale's development, Maas stated, ""In the 10 years that I've been working on the series, Throne of Glass has become more of an original epic fantasy than a Cinderella retelling, but you can still find a few nods to the legend here and there.""


=== Characters ===

In an interview prior to the series' debut, Maas discussed the process of creating her protagonist:

I grew up reading books like Robin McKinley's The Hero and the Crown and Garth Nix's Sabriel—both of which feature strong heroines, and both of which profoundly shaped my identity and empowered me. I started writing knowing I wanted to create books like that—mostly because that's what interests me and where my passion lies, but also because I'd love for some young woman to read [Throne of Glass] and feel empowered, too.
The story's teenage heroine, Celaena Sardothien, is introduced as an orphan who was raised and trained by an assassin. She is characterized as skilled, arrogant, and witty. While shaping her protagonist, Maas was inspired by the heroism of Eowyn from The Lord of the Rings, and by the characterization of Velma Kelly from Chicago. Maas has stated that the latter's ""arrogance and fierceness made me want to write about a woman like her—about a woman who never once said sorry for being talented and determined and utterly in love with herself.""
The author ultimately designed Celaena as a highly capable character whose talents also form a basis for numerous faults. In interviews preceding the series' release, Maas noted her heroine's issues with ""impatience"" and ""vanity"". She also suggested that Celaena would grow while adjusting to her new role. In addition to Celaena's skills as an assassin, Maas wanted the character to have several traits and hobbies befitting her age, including a fondness for ""shopping, books, and fine dining"", as well as a ""penchant for getting into trouble.""
In creating the friendship between Celaena and Chaol, Maas gave the characters a number of differences. As the story begins, Chaol is introduced as a strict and ethical captain, while Celaena is presented as a morally ambiguous assassin. According to the author, this contrast contributes to Chaol's character development as his bond with Celaena grows. Amidst their experiences, Chaol eventually comes to view her not just as a captive criminal, but also ""as a human being."" While writing the novel, Maas envisioned Chaol as a character who had ""always seen the world in black and white,"" and concluded that ""Celaena just throws a wrench in that.""
Prince Dorian is presented as a suitor for Celaena as well. However, their relationship is complicated by his status as the crown prince.


== Release ==


=== Publicity ===
In anticipation of the series' debut, Bloomsbury released e-book editions of four prequel novellas—The Assassin and the Pirate Lord, The Assassin and the Desert, The Assassin and the Underworld, and The Assassin and the Empire—between January and July 2012. Throne of Glass was previewed by Publishers Weekly in February, while the book trailer premiered on MTV.com in May.  Additionally, film option rights were acquired by Creative Artists Agency.


=== Reception ===
Throne of Glass has received generally positive reviews, making its debut on the New York Times Best Seller list with the release of the second novel, Crown of Midnight. A review from Publishers Weekly lauded the series' opening as a ""strong debut novel."" The review went on to state, ""This is not cuddly romance, but neither is it grim. Celaena is trained to murder, yet she hasn’t lost her taste for pretty dresses or good books, and a gleam of optimism tinges her outlook. Maas tends toward overdescription, but the verve and freshness of the narration make for a thrilling read."" The Guardian gave it 5 stars out of 5 with the author of the review stating that the main character, Celaena, was more ""relatable"" than most other female protagonists. In her review for USA Today, Serena Chase called Celaena a ""next-level Cinderella"".
Kirkus stated, ""A teenage assassin, a rebel princess, menacing gargoyles, supernatural portals and a glass castle prove to be as thrilling as they sound."" With regard to the protagonist, Kirkus noted that ""Celaena is still just a teenager trying to forge her way, giving the story timelessness. She might be in the throes of a bloodthirsty competition, but that doesn't mean she's not in turmoil over which tall, dark and handsomely titled man of the royal court should be her boyfriend—and which fancy gown she should wear to a costume party."" The review concluded that the story's ""commingling of comedy, brutality and fantasy evokes a rich alternate universe with a spitfire young woman as its brightest star.""
Throne of Glass was named Amazon.com's ""Best Book of the Month for Kids & Teens"" in August 2012. Whitney Kate Sullivan of Romantic Times stated that ""Maas' YA fantasy world is one of the most compelling that this reviewer has visited all year. The assassin heroine's growth and the multilayered secondary characters are amazing."" Serena Chase of USA Today applauded the story's love triangle, and noted that ""Maas excels at world building, spicing up this unusual take on the Cinderella story by injecting myths, fairy tales and religious traditions with the magic of a fresh and faulted world. Whereas many authors rely on geographic detail to build their worlds, Maas' environment is more politically driven and her characterizations are deftly drawn to support that sort of structure."" Chase also commended Maas for creating ""a truly remarkable heroine who doesn't sacrifice the grit that makes her real in order to do what's right in the end.""

Terra Mystica,Play fantastical factions. Expand your influence by terraforming and joining cults.,2012,2,5,4,60,150,12,3.97,Strategy ,,"A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game, (generally just referred to as board games in Europe) is a class of tabletop games that generally has indirect player interaction and multiple ways to score points. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit.


== History ==

Due in part to postwar aversion to products which glorified conflict, the 3M series of strategy and economic games, including Acquire, became popular in Germany and provided a template for a new form of gameplay without direct conflict or warfare. 


=== German family board games ===
The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany. The genre has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Settlers of Catan, first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe.
Though neither the first Eurogame nor the first such game to find an audience outside Germany, it became much more popular than any of its predecessors. It quickly sold millions of copies in Germany, and in the process brought money and attention to the genre as a whole.


=== 21st century ===
Germany purchased more board games per capita than any other country as of 2009. While many Eurogames are published and played in Anglophone markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, and Alhambra.


== Characteristics ==

Eurogames tend to be focused on challenge for players. They feature economics and the acquisition of resources rather than direct conflict, and have a limited amount of luck. They also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict. Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the wargames that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as SPI and Avalon Hill, but nonetheless often have a considerable depth of play.
One consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as Puerto Rico that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like Terra Mystica and Tzolkin being significantly more difficult to master.


=== Incentive for social play ===

While many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, Eurogames are, for the most part, well-suited to social play. In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. In contrast to games such as Risk or Monopoly, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a pre-determined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources.  Playing time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. Generally Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge; although there is a sizeable body of German-style games that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate anywhere from two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare, with Power Grid and Caverna (the latter supporting seven player games) being two examples, or require expansions, as with The Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. Players usually play for themselves individually, rather than in a partnership or team.
A growing number of Eurogames support solo play with modified rulesets. To win, the player either has to achieve specific single-player campaign goals or beat the score of a simulated opponent that takes actions according to special rules outlined in the scenario. Recent Eurogames suitable for solo play include Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island.


=== No player elimination ===
Another prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination.  Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games.  Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game. Related to no-player-elimination, Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead. A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing. Balancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders. This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end, an example of which is Power Grid, where the turn order is determined by number of cities (and biggest power plant as the tie-breaker), such that players further ahead are handicapped in their option of plays.


=== Game mechanics ===
A wide variety of often innovative mechanisms or mechanics are used, and familiar mechanics such as rolling dice and moving, capture, or trick taking are avoided. If a game has a board, the board is usually irregular rather than uniform or symmetric (such as Risk rather than chess or Scrabble). The board is often random (as in The Settlers of Catan) or has random elements (such as Tikal). Some boards are merely mnemonic or organizational and contribute only to ease of play, such as a cribbage board; examples of this include Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence. Random elements are often present but do not usually dominate the game. While rules are light to moderate, they allow depth of play, usually requiring thought, planning, and a shift of tactics through the game and featuring a chess- or backgammon-like opening game, middle game, and end game.
Stewart Woods' Eurogames cites six examples of mechanics common to eurogames:

Tile Placement – spatial placement of game components on the playing board.
Auctions – includes open and hidden auctions of both resources and actions from other players and the game system itself.
Trading/Negotiation – not simply trading resources of equivalent values, but allowing players to set markets.
Set Collection – collecting resources in specific groups that are then cashed in for points or other currency.
Area Control – also known as area majority or influence, this involves controlling a game element or board space through allocation of resources.
Worker Placement or Role Selection – players choose specific game actions in sequential order, with players disallowed from choosing a previously selected action.


=== Low randomness ===

Eurogame designs tend to de-emphasize luck and random elements. Often, the only random element of the game will be resource or terrain distribution in the initial setup, or (less frequently) the random order of a set of event or objective cards. The role played by deliberately random mechanics in other styles of game is instead fulfilled by the unpredictability of the behavior of other players.


=== Themes ===
Examples of themes are:

Carcassonne – build a medieval landscape complete with walled cities, monasteries, roads, and fields.
Puerto Rico – develop plantations on the island of Puerto Rico, set in the 18th century.
Power Grid – expand a power company's network and buy better plants.
Imperial – as an international investor, influence the politics of pre-World War I European empires.
Bruxelles 1893 – take the role of an Art Nouveau architect during the late 19th century and try to become the most famous architect in Belgium.


=== Game designer as author ===
Although not relevant to actual play, the name of the game's designer is often prominently mentioned on the box, or at least in the rule book. Top designers enjoy considerable following among enthusiasts of Eurogames. For this reason, the name ""designer games"" is often offered as a description of the genre. Recently, there has also been a wave of games designed as spin-offs of popular novels, such as the games taking their style from the German bestsellers Der Schwarm and Tintenherz.

=== Events ===

The Internationale Spieltage, also known as Essen Spiel, or the Essen Games Fair, is the largest non-digital game convention in the world, and the place where the largest number of Eurogames are released each year. Founded in 1983 and held annually in Essen, Germany, the fair was founded with the objective of providing a venue for people to meet and play board games, and show gaming as an integral part of German culture.
A ""World Boardgaming Championships"" is held annually in July in Pennsylvania, USA.  The event is nine days long and includes tournament tracks of over a hundred games; while traditional wargames are played there, all of the most popular tournaments are Eurogames and it is generally perceived as a Eurogame-centered event.  Attendance is international, though players from the U.S. and Canada predominate.


=== Awards ===
The most prestigious German board game award is the Spiel des Jahres (""Game of the Year""). The award is very family-oriented, with shorter, more approachable games such as Ticket to Ride and Elfenland usually preferred by the committee that gives out the award.
In 2011, the jury responsible for the Spiel des Jahres created the Kennerspiel des Jahres, or connoisseur's game of the year, for more complex games.
The Deutscher Spiele Preis (""German game prize"") is also awarded to games that are more complex and strategic, such as Puerto Rico. However, there are a few games with broad enough appeal to win both awards: The Settlers of Catan (1995), Carcassonne (2001), Dominion (2009).


== Influence ==
Xbox Live Arcade has included popular games from the genre, with Catan being released to strong sales on May 13, 2007, Carcassonne being released on June 27, 2007. Lost Cities and Ticket to Ride soon followed. Alhambra was due to follow later in 2007 until being cancelled.
The iPhone received versions of The Settlers of Catan and Zooloretto in 2009. Carcassonne was added to the iPhone App Store in June 2010. Later, Ticket to Ride was developed for both the iPhone and the iPad, significantly boosting sales of the board game.

Concordia,Lead your Roman dynasty and build the greatest trading empire in the Mediterranean.,2013,2,5,4,100,100,13,3.01,Strategy ,,"A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game, (generally just referred to as board games in Europe) is a class of tabletop games that generally has indirect player interaction and multiple ways to score points. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit.


== History ==

Due in part to postwar aversion to products which glorified conflict, the 3M series of strategy and economic games, including Acquire, became popular in Germany and provided a template for a new form of gameplay without direct conflict or warfare. 


=== German family board games ===
The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany. The genre has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Settlers of Catan, first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe.
Though neither the first Eurogame nor the first such game to find an audience outside Germany, it became much more popular than any of its predecessors. It quickly sold millions of copies in Germany, and in the process brought money and attention to the genre as a whole.


=== 21st century ===
Germany purchased more board games per capita than any other country as of 2009. While many Eurogames are published and played in Anglophone markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, and Alhambra.


== Characteristics ==

Eurogames tend to be focused on challenge for players. They feature economics and the acquisition of resources rather than direct conflict, and have a limited amount of luck. They also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict. Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the wargames that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as SPI and Avalon Hill, but nonetheless often have a considerable depth of play.
One consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as Puerto Rico that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like Terra Mystica and Tzolkin being significantly more difficult to master.


=== Incentive for social play ===

While many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, Eurogames are, for the most part, well-suited to social play. In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. In contrast to games such as Risk or Monopoly, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a pre-determined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources.  Playing time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. Generally Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge; although there is a sizeable body of German-style games that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate anywhere from two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare, with Power Grid and Caverna (the latter supporting seven player games) being two examples, or require expansions, as with The Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. Players usually play for themselves individually, rather than in a partnership or team.
A growing number of Eurogames support solo play with modified rulesets. To win, the player either has to achieve specific single-player campaign goals or beat the score of a simulated opponent that takes actions according to special rules outlined in the scenario. Recent Eurogames suitable for solo play include Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island.


=== No player elimination ===
Another prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination.  Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games.  Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game. Related to no-player-elimination, Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead. A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing. Balancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders. This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end, an example of which is Power Grid, where the turn order is determined by number of cities (and biggest power plant as the tie-breaker), such that players further ahead are handicapped in their option of plays.

Dune: Imperium,"Influence, intrigue, and combat in the universe of Dune.",2020,1,4,"3, 4",60,120,14,2.97,Strategy,  Thematic,"Dune is a strategy board game set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe, published by Avalon Hill in 1979. The game was designed by Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge and Peter Olotka. After many years out of print, the game was reissued by Gale Force Nine in 2019 in advance of the 2021 Dune film adaptation.


== History ==
The game was originally designed with a Roman Empire theme, with the name Tribute. Avalon Hill had acquired the license to produce a Dune game, but when their design proved unusable, the company contacted Eberle, Kittredge and Olotka. Elements suitable for the Dune universe were added to the game, particularly from their earlier game, Cosmic Encounter.
In 1984, to tie in with the Dune film, Avalon Hill published a second edition of the game as well as two expansions, Spice Harvest and The Duel.
The Spice Harvest expansion changes the initial setup of the standard game by adding a pre-game in which the factions lobby for control of the inter-world Spice market in order to purchase a more advantageous initial position for the start of the main game (control for the planet of Arrakis).
The Duel adds ""leader tokens"" representing the primary leaders of each faction and a secondary board representing a circular arena for one-on-one combat. Leaders may fight individual combat using a special deck of cards for movement and attacks.
Both supplements included additional Treachery Cards. Both supplements are also incorporated into the French edition published by Jeux Descartes.
In addition, Avalon Hill's strategy magazines, The General and Heroes, published counters and rules for three additional factions: the Bene Tleilax, the Ixians, and the Landsraad, factions and organizations that appeared in Frank Herbert's original novels.
The game received good reviews and due to the popularity of the Dune setting, coupled with the lack of new edition since 1984, became a sought-after item among board game collectors, with prices on secondary market reaching hundreds of dollars. A fan-made print-and-play version was also made available online around 2010.
In the 1990s, Jeux Descartes published a French edition of the game.
The game was reprinted by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012 as Rex: Final Days of an Empire. Fantasy Flight was able to acquire the rights to the system used in Dune (known as the “Simultaneous Dial Based Order System”), but were not able to get the license for the Dune setting. As a result, the game's setting was switched to Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe.
With the demise of Avalon Hill, Dune remained out of print for many years despite being a highly regarded board game. With newfound interest in the Dune series due to the upcoming 2021 Dune film, board game publisher Gale Force 9 reached out to the Herbert estate, which owns the general rights to the game, and received permission to remake it. The art was new for this edition, drawn by Russian illustrator ""Ilya77"", who was commissioned for the reuse of their art, in addition to the game's original designers, Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, and Peter Olotka. Gale Force 9 made very few changes of the game's original rules, tweaking about 3 to 5 percent of the rules. The game was released on October 30, 2019 in advance of the Dune cinematic reboot in late 2021. Along with the reprint, Gale Force Nine also released three expansion sets that allows players to control six additional factions, Ixians, the Tleilaxu, CHOAM, House Richese, House Ecaz, and House Moritani, co-designed by Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.


== Gameplay ==
Players take on the role of one of the factions in the politics of the planet Arrakis. Victory in the game is achieved by controlling a specified number of strongholds, either alone or in an alliance with other players.
The game board, which is based on the book's original map, represents the planet's northern hemisphere. It is divided into radial sections and territories, some of which overlap multiple radial sections. Five territories contain strongholds.
The radial divisions are used exclusively for storm movement. The planet's permanent coriolis storm moves along the radial sections, destroying any troops in its way. It is possible for a multi-radial territory to be partly in storm and partly clear.
Players move their units from territory to territory. If two or more players enter the same territory, a battle ensues and the contest is resolved using a hidden bidding system based on troop numbers, leaders, and possible treachery cards.
Spice serves as money. Each turn, one territory (determined by a card draw) produces a ""spice blow"", which places an amount of spice in that territory. This is one of the two ways in which all factions can earn spice for auctions, transportation, revival, and negotiating deals. The other is by winning a battle in which a leader is killed, which earns the faction the leader's value in spice.
An auction is held each turn in which players can purchase ""treachery cards"". These cards contain a variety of uses such as weapons and defenses, which can be used as advantages in resolving battles.
Each player has five leader tokens of varying strengths. Leaders are used in combat to supplement the strength of their units. However, each player may have one or more traitors among the other players' leaders, so using leaders can be a risk. Leaders can be killed in combat, but players may use spice to buy dead leaders back from the Bene Tleilaxu tanks.


=== Combat ===
Battle results when a territory is contested. Combat is resolved using a battle wheel, which consists of three parts: the number of troops, the leader, and any treachery cards which will be used during the battle.
Each player in the contest chooses in secret to sacrifice a number of their troops in that territory. Each unit sacrificed gives them a base score of one. Leader tokens add to the strength of their side, provided it survives the attack by the opposing leader. Attacks and defenses affecting leaders are chosen in secret by the players from their available treachery cards.
Once both players have chosen their strategies, they reveal the number of units, leaders and items used. If the player has chosen their opponent's traitor, they are defeated. Otherwise, if a player has used a weapon against which the other player has not used a defense, their opponent's leader is killed. If a laser is used against a shield, all units and leaders are killed from both sides. Otherwise, the scores are then added together, and the player with the lower score is defeated. The player with the higher score, while victorious, still must lose the number of units they planned in their strategy.  In the event of a tie, the attacking player wins the battle.


=== Factions ===
Each faction has unique powers which modify the rules. Both the default abilities and the optional ""Additional Character Advantages"" are included below.

House Atreides
During auctions, the Atreides player may use ""prescience"" to view the treachery card being bid on, while other players must bid blind. The Atreides player may also use prescience to look at the next spice blow card, and force their opponents to reveal one element of their battle plan. In advanced rules, the Atreides player may bring the Kwizatz Haderach into play, which adds a bonus to the battle wheel.
The Bene Gesserit
The Bene Gesserit player may temporarily ""coexist"" with other players' units without causing a confrontation, which allows transportation of one unit to the polar sink free of charge for every other player's transport. The player may command other players to use or not to use certain cards during combat (representing their use of ""the Voice""). At the beginning of the game the Bene Gesserit player secretly records the name of another player and the turn at which they think that other player will win the game. If the Bene Gesserit correctly guesses who will win and when, they win the game instead. In advanced rules, Bene Gesserit units are capable of extended coexistence and arrive in the same territory as the other player's transport.
The Padishah Emperor
When the other players buy treachery cards, they pay the Emperor. The player may revive up to three additional units as gholas. In advanced play, the Emperor has five elite units (Sardaukar) that are twice as effective as ordinary units, although they lose this bonus against the Fremen.
The Fremen
The Fremen armies are already on Arrakis, so they need not pay shipping costs to the Guild. They are also able to use ""desert power"" to move two territories per turn instead of one. Their troops are not killed if a worm appears; instead, they can ride the worm to a location of their choice. If no-one has won after ten turns and certain strongholds are either unoccupied or occupied by the Fremen, they win. In advanced play, they have three elite units (Fedaykin), and only suffer half losses from the storm.
The Spacing Guild
The Guild player receives the payment when other players transport units onto the board, while paying only half for transporting themselves. They can ship units around the planet, or even send them back to their reserves. If no-one has won after ten turns, and the Fremen don't win, the Guild does. In advanced play, they can choose to take their turn at any point during a turn.
House Harkonnen
When the Harkonnen player buys a treachery card, they receive a second one free, without having to show it to the Atreides player. They can hold twice as many treachery cards as other players, to a maximum of eight. Where the other players must choose one traitor out of four, the Harkonnen player can keep all four. In advanced rules, whenever they win a battle, they may kill or temporarily capture a random leader from the loser.
Each faction also grants some aspect of their powers to their allies.


=== Winning ===
A faction wins by controlling three of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. An alliance of factions wins by controlling four of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. In a game with only two factions, the winning faction must control four strongholds.
In a recommended ""longer game"" variant a faction or alliance of factions must control four strongholds, or all five in a game with only two factions.
Three other winning conditions exist:
The Fremen win at the end of turn 10 (the final round of game play) if no faction has won the game by the normal criteria and the occupancy of certain strongholds meets certain constraints. This win condition represents a situation where the Fremen have prevented interference with their own plans for Dune.
The Guild wins if, at the end of turn 10, no faction has won via the conventional win, and the Fremen win conditions are not met. This win condition represents the situation where the Guild has preserved the status quo on Dune and may continue to provide shipping services.
The Bene Gesserit win if, after a faction or alliance has succeeded in a conventional win, they reveal that they predicted (prior to the game's start) that that faction would win in that turn. The Bene Gesserit need only predict one of the winning players in the event of an alliance win. If the Bene Gesserit cause their own alliance to win in the turn that they predicted one of their allies would win, then the Bene Gesserit alone win. This win condition represents the situation where the Bene Gesserit have manipulated the situation so that their hidden agenda is fulfilled.
The Bene Gesserit cannot predict the Fremen or Guild turn 10 default wins.  However they may predict that the Fremen or the Guild will win in turn 10 by the normal majority stronghold occupancy criteria.


== Reception ==
In the January–February 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 26), Tony Watson commented that ""Not only is Dune a good game, it does an amazingly accurate job of conveying the feel and air of Dune the novel.""
In the inaugural edition of Ares Magazine (March 1980), Eric Goldberg gave it a below average rating of 6 out of 9, saying, ""Battles are won and lost dependent on the number of spice tokens present in an area. Treachery, storms and the fearsome shai-hulud (gigantic sandworms) enliven affairs. Dune is a nice little game, but nothing special.""
In Issue 77 of the UK magazine Games & Puzzles, Nick Palmer was impressed, writing, ""The ability of the game to bring out the delicate power balance in the planetary power struggle depicted by the book is nothing short of extraordinary — and yet the rules occupy a mere three pages!"" However, Palmer had issues with the alliance rule, which states that players in an alliance can jointly win the game. But Palmer pointed out ""A strong alliance can generally win at once, and if one wants to avoid an abrupt ending it seems best to limit wins to single players. One can then employ Diplomacy-like cunning in lining up some unsuspecting allies before making a dash for victory, since allies cannot interfere with each other's plans until alliances are reviewed when the next sandworm appears.""  Nonetheless, Palmer game the game an Excitement rating of 5 out of 5, saying, ""Dune is in my view the best game that appeared in 1979, simple, fast-moving, yet packed with strategic and tactical ingenuity.""
In the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered Dune a classic, saying ""Unique flavor comes with the movement rules, combat strategies, and chances that your leaders will turn traitor."" However, Varney advised ""Don’t bother with the unbalanced advanced rules that Avalon Hill foisted on the clean basic design.""
In a retrospective review in There Will Be Games, Jonathan Volk gave high praise to the game's unusual, asymmetrical design. In Dune, he noted, there is no artificial balance, no ""Arthurian circularity"" to the game table: the various player positions have wildly differing strengths and weaknesses, and the unfairness of the world setup makes ""a seductive point of entry"". More importantly, that unfairness presses players into complex social relations and moral quandaries rarely found in games. It's ""impossibly good, better than any board game I’ve played, and I’ve played a lot of them,"" wrote Volk, summing up: ""No game lingers with me more than Dune.
Tom Mendelsohn, in a retrospective review from Ars Technica, stated that the game was ""moderately popular"" during its release, but commented that the 1984 re-release was commercially unsuccessful. Mendelsohn, however, stated that the game was ""ahead of its time"", shown by the variable number of rounds each game. The reviewer additionally complimented the tenseness, the combat as a ""state-of-the-art"" mechanic that is a ""battle of wits and bluffing"", and praised the hidden information and ""bursts of chaos"". Nevertheless, the asymmetry was criticised as unappealing to some players, Mehdelsohn also stated that the rules are ""full of holes and ambiguities"" and that the expansions are dubiously necessary. The review also described that Rex: Final Days of an Empire was received less favourably. Similar to Mendelsohn, who commented that Dune ""features more than a few rough edges courtesy of how ahead of its time it was"", Luke Plunkett from Kotaku observed that the game had ""rough edges"", criticising that ""If a major publisher was pitched Dune in 2020 they’d likely tear it to pieces, aghast at how so many of this game’s features are seemingly worthless, overpowered or both at the same time."" Nonetheless, he praised that the ""elastic nature"" of victory conditions and ""treachery lurking"", and complimented the engagement in consequence of ""unpredictability and unfairness"".

== Expansions ==
The Duel is a 1984 expansion for Dune published by The Avalon Hill Game Company. It provides optional rules for duels between character groups.
Steve Crow reviewed The Duel in The Space Gamer No. 76. Crow commented that ""In all, The Duel makes an interesting supplement to the original Dune rules, but overuse of the challenge rules just bogs down the game.""
The 2019 Gale Force Nine edition has released three expansions to date, Ixians & Tleilaxu, which adds both of those factions, along with Tech Tokens and additional Treachery Cards, and other new cards, CHOAM & Richese, which adds two more factions, Leader Skill Cards, and Advanced Stronghold Cards, and Ecaz & Moritani, which adds another two factions, homeworld tokens, and new cards.
All three expansions were designed by Eberle, Kittridge, and Olotka, along with Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.

Arkham Horror: The Card Game,Investigate the horrors of Arkham while courting cosmic doom.,2016,1,2,2,60,120,14,3.48,Customizable,  Thematic,"Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure board game designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by Chaosium. The game is based on Chaosium's roleplaying game Call of Cthulhu, which is set in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other horror writers. The game's second edition was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005, with a third edition in 2018.


== Overview ==
The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional Massachusetts town of Arkham in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other planes open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.)  Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as ""sanity""), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates.
After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate.  While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them.  As gates open, a ""Doom Track"" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham.  In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose.  In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise, they lose.


== History ==
Arkham Horror was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game, a new strategic game based on their Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. It was edited in-house by Chaosium, who added such features as the Doom Track, a method to track progress toward the total failure of the players, and was published in 1987 as Arkham Horror.  The game won the ""Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1987"" award in the Origins Awards, becoming the first Lovecraft themed board game to achieve significant popularity.
Arkham Horror was one of several Lovecraft-based board games submitted by Launius, with other designs from the same period including 'The Trail of the Brotherhood', 'DreamQuests', and 'Imprisoned with the Pharaohs'. Arkham Horror was the only of these games to see professional publication.
The original printing of Arkham Horror sold out. Chaosium announced reprints several times, but they never occurred, and Chaosium discontinued production of the game in 1991.
In 2004 online game company Skotos acquired the rights to Arkham Horror from Richard Launius, and later arranged publication with Fantasy Flight Games. The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, Kevin Wilson at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a roll-and-move system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay.  The 2005 edition shares art and other elements with Fantasy Flight Games' other Cthulhu Mythos-based game: Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game.
The new edition was released in July 2005 and sold out, with a second reprinting also being released in 2005.
In early 2011, Fantasy Flight released Elder Sign, a game based on Arkham Horror but which provides a much faster-paced alternative. By streamlining many of Arkham Horror's mechanics and using dice to solve encounters, games of Elder Sign lasts 90 minutes on average, rather than 2–4 hours.
In 2016 at Arkham Nights, a celebration of Cthulhu games by Fantasy Flight Games, the original designer Richard Launius returned to host a special event using a modified version of the original game.  Multiple games were held over the course of the weekend.
In November 2019, Aconyte Books announced a-tie in novels based on the world of Arkham Horror, titled Arkham Horror: Wrath of N’Kai. The novel is set to be published in May 2020.
A video game adaptation, Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace, was released in March 2021.


== 1987 edition ==

The 1987 version of Arkham Horror has the following game components: a board map of the town of Arkham; 99 playing cards with various events; 50 monster counters; two 4-page investigator rules sheets; eight investigator cards; eight pawns; and markers.  The cards and tokens are illustrated with black-and-white drawings and silhouettes. The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces.
There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location.
Investigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength.
The turns of the investigators are preceded by the ""Mythos Phase"", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one.
For each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the ""Doom of Arkham"" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose.
Victory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one.


=== Reception ===
In the April 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue 168), Ken Rolston called the game his ""first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect."" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, ""If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.""

== 2005 edition ==


=== Gameplay ===

Each player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to ""slide"" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, Lore and Luck is one pair - if the player maximizes their character's Lore, they simultaneously minimize their Luck.
Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of Sanity and Stamina. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. hit points). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of roleplaying to the game.
Each player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.
The basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).
Characters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when the player spends a Clue token on that particular type of roll.
Each turn, the players move their characters on the board, fight or evade monsters and have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location). They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.
Characters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.
At the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters.
If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.
Certain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an Elder Sign item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.
If the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.


=== Expansions ===
Arkham Horror has received a total of eight expansions:

Curse of the Dark Pharaoh, released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011. This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on Nyarlathotep, one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.
Dunwich Horror, released during Gen Con 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story The Dunwich Horror, it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, new Great Old Ones, and new mechanics for defeated characters: a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores them to their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues; and when they lose their last point of Stamina, they may take a similar Injury card. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.
The King in Yellow, confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like Curse of the Dark Pharaoh, it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the Robert W. Chambers story The King in Yellow, this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald — a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does, unless the player takes a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the Fantasy Flight Games website as a Herald for the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the Dunwich Horror expansion.
Kingsport Horror, released in June 2008. It is similar to Dunwich Horror in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other ""aquatic"" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.
Black Goat of the Woods, released at Gen Con in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow the player to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.
Innsmouth Horror, announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009. The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.
The Lurker at the Threshold, announced in February 2010 and released in July 2010. This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. Also introduced were Relationships, which are cards describing how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit, and a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself.
Miskatonic Horror, announced in February 2011 and released in July 2011. The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Other World, and Mythos cards. Rather than building on the content of the base game, this expansion builds on the content of the other expansions, adding more features that can be used the more other expansions are included. New player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant were included as well.


=== Reception ===
Ben Kuchera reviewed the game for Ars Technica, and noted that in a game with 700 tokens ""brevity is not one of its strengths ... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased."" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, ""it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.""


== 2018 edition ==
A third edition of Arkham Horror was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018. This version incorporates design elements from Eldritch Horror and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. An expansion, Dead of Night, was released on October 8, 2019. A second expansion, Under Dark Waves, re-exploring Innsmouth and Kingsport, was released on September 18, 2020. On June 11, 2021, a third expansion titled Secrets of the Order was released, this time taking players to the French Hill neighborhood and the underworld.


== Novels ==
In 2011 a series of novels were published under the Arkham Horror banner via Fantasy Flight Games, beginning with Ghouls of the Miskatonic by Graham McNeill. A new series, beginning with Wrath of N'kai by Joshua Reynolds, began publication in 2020 through Aconyte.

Players take up to two actions per turn using individual player boards, and the game proceeds until one player has earned six achievements. At this point, the players receive coins for the achievements they have attained and the territories they control, and the player with the most coins is declared the winner.
Stonemaier Games crowdfunded the development of Scythe, raising over $1.8 million through a Kickstarter campaign. Scythe was released to critical and commercial praise for its gameplay, combination of Eurogame and combat mechanics, theme, and the game artwork, which was produced by Polish painter Jakub Różalski under the name World of 1920+. Three major expansions, a spin-off, and a digital version have been released for the game.


== Gameplay ==

Scythe takes place in an alternative history version of 1920s Europe that is recovering from the effects of the great war. Players represent different factions seeking their fortune in the redeveloping landscape. Players build an economic engine by selecting one of four main actions each turn. Each action is listed on the top of a personal player board, and players cannot take the same action in consecutive turns. They may also take a corresponding second action as listed on their player board. Actions allow players to move units on the board, trade for or produce goods, bolster their military for combat, deploy mechs, enlist recruits for continuous bonuses or build structures. The actions themselves may also be upgraded, making them either less costly to enact or stronger when deployed.
Each player is given six stars, which are placed onto the board when they complete specific goals, such as deploying all four of their mechs. The game immediately ends when one player has placed 6 stars. Players then tally the money that they receive from achievements earned, territory controlled, and gathered resources based on their in-game popularity achieved; the player who finishes the game with the most money wins.


== Development and release ==
Scythe was designed by Jamey Stegmaier, the CEO of Stonemaier Games, and was revealed as a Kickstarter campaign on October 13, 2015. Backers contributed over $1.8 million to the campaign. Physical copies of the game were delivered to backers in July 2016; it was later released in Gen Con and other retail stores the following month.
Approximately 130 alternate history artworks were illustrated by the Polish artist Jakub Różalski. The game's theme is set in the 1920+ alternate history universe, which was inspired by the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921, and also later used in Iron Harvest. The plot focuses on the conflict between several nations in Central and Eastern Europe that occurred in the aftermath of World War I. The factions are Polania, Rusviet, Saxony, Crimea, Nordic (based on Poland, Soviet Russia, Imperial Germany, Crimean Khanate, and Scandinavia, respectively). The video gaming website Polygon also stated that the artwork also was ""the inspiration for dozens of objective and narrative cards"". 
During playtesting, Stegmaier asked players to quantitatively rate the game with a maximum score of ten, and described that ""when I start to see those ratings creep over 8, I know we’re getting really close"". Scythe also includes the Automa, a solo-player mode designed by Morten Monrad Pedersen, who also contributed to other Stonemaier Games products including Wingspan and Viticulture. He stated the difficulty in designing one-player games was for the Automas to resemble human players while being streamlined, which required ""a purging of unnecessary mechanics"" to reduce the downtime.


=== Expansions ===
Scythe has received three major expansions and several promotional packages. The first expansion, Scythe: Invaders from Afar, was released in 2016. It added new player mats and two new factions into the game, increasing the player count from five to seven. The new factions are Albion and Togawa (based on United Kingdom and Japan, respectively). The second expansion, Scythe: The Wind Gambit, was released in 2017, featuring airships and adding variable end-game conditions to the base game. The Wind Gambit was met with praise for its new victory conditions and components, but the airships were critiqued for providing only limited appeal as the game progressed. In 2017, The Wind Gambit won the Golden Geek Award for Best Game Expansion.
Scythe: The Rise of Fenris was published in 2018 as the third expansion of Scythe. It introduced 11 modules, featuring an eight-episode campaign, two factions (Fenris and Vesna), a cooperative mode, and a multiplayer Automa variant. The Rise of Fenris was met with positive reviews, winning the 2018 Golden Geek Award for Best Game Expansion. Hall praised the storyline, art, and enhancements to replayability provided by the expansion, while Williams described each module as ""mind-blowing"" and the campaign as ""flavorful, exciting, memorable and, most importantly, extremely fun"".
Outside of traditional expansions, Stonemaier Games has released several promotional packages for Scythe. Scythe Encounters, published in December 2018, included a set of 32 promotional encounter cards designed primarily from fan submissions. Scythe Modular Board, which alters the in-game map, was released in July 2019. In late 2020, Scythe Complete Rulebook was released. It was compiled by Matt Griepp and Brittany Griepp, and combined rulebooks for the base game and expansions.


=== Alternate versions ===
In 2017, Stonemaier Games published a stand-alone spin-off to Scythe. Titled My Little Scythe, the game was initially a fan project that was later developed into a print and play designed by Hoby and Vienna Chou, which received the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Print and Play game. The game was inspired by Scythe and featured similar mechanisms, but was re-themed and simplified for a more casual, family-friendly experience. Initially, the designer wanted to incorporate the My Little Pony franchise, although due to problems with licensing, the board game is not directly connected to that franchise. An expansion adding two new factions and airships, titled My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky, was released in June 2020.
In a Techraptor review, Travis Williams praised the game’s accessibility, engagement, mechanics, playtime, and components. This sentiment was echoed by Polygon, which also praised the game's accessibility and mechanics. Michał Szewczyk from Rebel Times concluded that the game is a well-executed if simplified version of Scythe, bridging the world of serious board games and family games. 
In 2018, Scythe: Digital Edition, a video game, was released by Asmodee Digital as a digital adaptation of Scythe. The game was released on 5 September 2018 on Steam for PC, including both Mac and Windows. In 2020, a mobile version was subsequently released and available to download on iOS and Android. Iron Harvest, a real-time strategy game inspired by Scythe's 1920s setting, was also released in September 2020, and was positively received for its artwork and thematic setting.


== Reception ==
Scythe was released to acclaim from board game critics, who praised its mechanism, gameplay, and art. It was listed as one of the best games of 2016 by several reviewers, including William Herkewitz from Popular Mechanics, Aaron Zimmerman from Ars Technica, Tomasz Sokoluk from Rebel Times, and Peter Jenkinson from the Telegraph. The reviewer Aaron Zimmerman described it as a ""deep, puzzly, interactive Euro-style board game"". Zimmerman also praised the complementary nature of the simple turn structure and the ""many complex, interlocking parts"" of the engine building mechanics. This sentiment was echoed by Matt Jarvis from Tabletop Gaming, who praised the game's balance of depth and accessibility, the ""cleverly designed"" player mats, and as the encounter mechanism, which he believed ""round[s] out Scythe's in-game universe and offer[s] a more micro-level human edge"". Several years after its release, Scythe appeared on a list from The Wirecutter of the best board games. The reviewers praised the game's ""immense strategic depth"" and ""beautiful, steampunk-meets-pastoral idyll world-building aesthetic"".
Reviewers particularly highlighted Scythe's use of Eurogame-style resource management and combat mechanics found in American-style board games. Zimmerman compared the simplicity of combat to the systems in Kemet and Dune, describing it as a ""tense exercise"", but also noted the relative infrequency of combat within the game world. Jarvis praised the ""quick and highly strategic"" combat system but found that resource production was instrumental for victory. Luke Plunkett from Kotaku also observed that resource management and construction were more significant for in-game success than combat. Różalski's artwork also received significant praise from reviewers, with Charlie Hall of Polygon acknowledging the game's use of artwork as a thematic core for objective and encounter cards and stating that each card ""is a treasure"". PC Gamer editor Jonathan Bolding also commended the art quality, noting that ""[t]he cards have fascinating scenes of agrarian life juxtaposed with smoking dieselpunk mechs and war machines"". Reviewing for the Dicebreaker, Alex Meehan praised the artwork displaying both the war setting and its ""consequences on the ordinary people"". She concluded that it was ""a huge draw for players looking for a game with an arresting setting"". Sokoluk also stated that the most distinctive element of the game is Różalski's art style, which has helped to create hype for the game even before its debut. Zimmerman was additionally complimentary, writing that the game is ""tied together through the stunning art"". 
The single-player artificial opponent, the Automa, was also well-received. Plunkett praised the functionality of the Automa as ""a great way to learn the ropes before getting a crew together"", but noted that there were major differences between the game's single- and multiplayer modes. Travis Williams from TechRaptor agreed, saying that the Automa was ""slickly designed"" and praising its suitability as a non-player faction in multiplayer games.

Scythe received four Golden Geek Awards from BoardGameGeek in 2016, for Board Game of the Year, Artwork & Presentation, Strategy Game, and Solo Game, while also placing as a runner-up for Most Innovative. The game was also well received commercially: as of April 2021, Stonemaier Games had sold over 382,000 copies. Scythe had the highest sales of any Stonemaier Game until 2021, when it was surpassed by Wingspan. 
Upon its release, Scythe: Digital Edition received mostly positive reviews upon its release on Steam. Calvin Wong Tze Loon from PC Gamer commended the ""slick tutorial"", the mechanisms, visuals and the soundtrack; concluding that it was ""evocative, clever, and rewarding"". Keith Law from Ars Technica also praised the visuals of the adaptation and engagement but criticised the price of 20 dollars and complexity of the tutorial. In a mixed review, CD-Action noted the game's similarity with the original board game, stating that ""Its biggest merit in the eyes of purists is arguably also its biggest flaw – Scythe: Digital Edition offers nothing that the original board game wouldn't"".

Clank!: Legacy – Acquisitions Incorporated,"""Go forth, be bold, and ACQUIRE!"" in this campaign version of ""Clank!""",2019,2,4,4,90,120,13,2.69,Thematic,,"A legacy game is a variant of tabletop board games in which the game itself is designed, through various mechanics, to change permanently over the course of a series of sessions.


== History ==
Game designer Rob Daviau claims to have come up with the idea at a work meeting after jokingly asking why the murderous characters in Clue are always invited back to dinner. Realizing that each new game resets, Daviau thought about what it would be like if everyone would remember who the murderer was, and he pitched the idea of a Clue legacy game to Hasbro.

While that idea was rejected, Daviau was later asked to use the mechanic in a new version of Risk. Risk Legacy was released in 2011 and was his first game to use this format.
Daviau followed up with an award-winning Pandemic variant, Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, which was released in 2015 to positive reviews and praised as a leap forward in modern board game design. Daviau continues to develop legacy games and co-developed a mechanic, the Echo System, to retain permanent changes through subsequent games in a franchise.
Daviau cited his work on Betrayal at House on the Hill (which was later adapted into a legacy version) and Trivial Pursuit: DVD – Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition as predecessors to the legacy idea. The latter was designed in such a way that pre-programmed games sorted the cards by difficulty. This caused some vocal backlash as the game was perceived by many to have a more definite end than other versions.


== Common mechanics and themes ==
Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. As such they have been compared to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. New rules can be introduced as the campaign goes on, allowing for the game to expand both mechanically and thematically. Games can use the expanding campaign as a mode of storytelling; Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 uses a three-act structure to tell its story. Daviau describes legacy games as ""experiential"" in contrast to traditional games, which are ""repeatable"". He compared his legacy games to that of a concert where you ""buy a ticket for an experience"" while Haoran Un of Kotaku describes the idea as ""avant-garde performance art"".
Legacy games break certain covenants that players expect from traditional board games. Permanent, physical changes can occur to components based on game outcomes and player choices. For instance players might be instructed to write names on cards, place stickers on the game board, or destroy some components. This causes each copy of the game to be unique at the end and has earned the legacy genre criticism in that there is a finite amount of replayability. Some games have been designed to be replayable with refill packs or non-permanent stickers while others are still playable with the final permanent changes once the campaign is over.

Puerto Rico,"Ship goods, construct buildings, and choose roles that benefit you more than others.",2002,3,5,4,90,150,12,3.28,Strategy ,,"Puerto Rico is a Euro-style board game designed by German designer Andreas Seyfarth and published in 2002 in a German-language  edition by Alea.  Players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico during the age of Caribbean ascendancy. Puerto Rico was the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek for over five years, until it was surpassed by Agricola. The aim of the game is to amass victory points in two ways: by exporting goods and by constructing buildings.
Puerto Rico can be played by three, four or five players, although an official two-player variant also exists. There is an official expansion released in 2004, which adds new buildings with different abilities that can replace or be used alongside those in the original game. A second, smaller expansion became available in 2009. Additionally, changes to the rules have been suggested that serve to balance the game.


== Gameplay ==
Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons (money).
The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.
During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as ""Trader"" or ""Builder""). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player who selected the role acts first and also receives a small privilege - for example, choosing the ""Builder"" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Roles that have already been selected earlier in a round are not available to be selected again. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.
The available roles are as follows:
Settler: Each player in turn order may select one of the plantation tiles available in the central offer and add it to their personal player board. The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players.
Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, ""violet buildings"" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game.
Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger.
Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type.
Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases.
Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply.
Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round.
Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a ""governor"" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.
Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned ""large buildings."" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.


=== Game balance variants ===
The following changes may be made to the official rules in order to create what some players believe is a more balanced game giving each player a more equal chance of winning:

The prices of the Factory and University buildings may be swapped, such that the Factory costs 8 doubloons and the university costs 7 doubloons. In a private conversation, the designer Andreas Seyfarth said he would make this change.
In a forum on BoardGameGeek, some players have suggested that players starting with a corn plantation should start with 1 doubloon fewer than players who start with an indigo plantation.


=== Ending ===
The game can end in three different ways:

Mayor is selected and there are not enough colonists to refill the colonist ship with the appropriate number.
Captain is selected and the last VP chip is given to a player. (Additional chips are to be used during that round, once the supply is exhausted.)
Builder is selected and a player has built out their 12th city space, thus having no room left to build.
In each case, players finish the current round before the game ends.
A player's total score is calculated by adding the number on each of their victory chips, the building value of all of their buildings, and the bonus points from large buildings. Manned large buildings award bonus points based on various game conditions (such as the Fortress, which gives one victory point for every three colonists on the player board, or the City Hall, which awards a point for every small or large violet building owned by the player).
The winner is the player with the most victory points. In the event of a tie, the player with the most total goods added to doubloons is given the tie-breaker. If a tie still exists between players, they tie.


=== Two-player variant ===
Puerto Rico was released as a 3-5 player game but later received an official two-player variant from Alea. The two-player game is played with one Prospector, and in each round both players select three roles, before a doubloon is added to the seventh role and the Governor tile switches sides. Some players prefer to instead play with just five roles being selected each round - three for the Governor and two for the non-Governor - so that players never have the ability to select twice in a row and pull off powerful combos (like Craftsman/Trader).


== Strategy ==
There are two primary strategies used in Puerto Rico, corresponding to the two means of earning victory points (VP). One strategy, often called the 'shipping strategy', is to attempt a high level of goods production, and to ship those goods back to the homeland for points. Corn is produced free and indigo has a low investment cost, therefore these goods are commonly chosen when this strategy is used because all exports are valued the same. The major disadvantage of this strategy is that doubloons are harder to acquire, and thus buildings are harder to build.
The other major strategy is to produce crops that are worth more (i.e. tobacco and coffee), and to use the cash produced from selling/trading to buy more buildings that also give new abilities. Expensive buildings can give a player many victory points, but fewer goods are likely to be shipped to the homeland, and so the VPs from exports can be expected to be low. In filling all their building spaces, a player can cause the game to end relatively quickly, before players using the 'shipping strategy' can capitalise on their investment in buildings and crops that increase shipment VPs.
There are also many minor strategies that play on the nuances of how the buildings interact.


== Expansions and online versions ==
In January 2004, Alea released an official expansion to Puerto Rico. The addition consists of 14 new buildings that may be used alongside of, or instead of, the original 17.
In February 2004, Seyfarth released a separate card game called San Juan for two, three or four players. It is based on Puerto Rico and published by the same companies, following the same art style and making use of some of the same buildings and resources.
A second expansion was under development, but it was later announced that it was cancelled. Instead, a different, but inclusive, expansion is included in the Alea 10th anniversary 'treasure chest' released in 2009, which contains expansions for a number of different games by the company. The Puerto Rico expansions included consist of the original expansion, as well as a small expansion of several new buildings and red 'nobleman' colonists, which interact with the new buildings. An English language translation of the new expansion was released at the end of 2009 by Rio Grande Games.
A playable online version is available, and, as of January 2017, 660,000 games had been played this way. An iPad version was launched in August 2011.


== Criticism ==
While Puerto Rico was highly reviewed upon its initial release in 2002, it has come under renewed attention since then for its core premise of colonialism.
In 2011, Jarrah E. Hodge at Bitch Media observed that ""Puerto Rico is sanitized of all references to the exploitation of African slaves on plantations, or the indigenous Taino inhabitants of the island, who were virtually wiped out by the Spanish colonists.""
In 2017, Sam Desatoff at Vice magazine wrote ""It feels disrespectful for Seyfarth to disregard slavery so completely. By using slavery as a gameplay mechanic without acknowledging the human cost of it (or even using its name directly), by rendering the institution to a mere tool, the true costs of running your economic engine are ignored. It almost seems to uncritically adopt the slavers' mindset, without any self-awareness. The effect is to make players gathered around a table for a game of Puerto Rico into unwitting moral accomplices in the horrors of human servitude.""
Academics Cornel Borit, Melania Borit, and Petter Olsen discussed Puerto Rico in a study of colonialism in popular board games in 2018. ""In Puerto Rico, the indigenous population is completely absent. The world is populated only by colonists who arrive from the metropolitan centres by ship and settle into the new world with the support of the administrator (i.e. the Mayor), fitting into the freshly colonised society in accordance with labour force needs. Thus, the subaltern, who, from a historical point of view, had inhabited the Greater Antilles prior to colonisation, is excluded from the re-enactment of this colonial reality. To use Spivak’s critical parlance, it has no voice within the simulated historical world of the game.""
Philosophy professor Stephanie Partridge wrote of Puerto Rico in 2019: ""Still, even those of us who are fairly good at seeing the connection between some games and our collective, colonialist past and present tend to find ourselves bracketing such concerns for the sake of gameplay. (Honestly, we probably pull in and out of the gameplay as the incorrigible social meanings impress themselves on us more or less, depending on what game activity we are carrying out). How many of us have carried on playing Puerto Rico or (Settlers of) Catan as if there are no indigenous peoples present in our fictionalized colonial world to “mess it up” — a terra nullius fantasy — or bracketing the (abstracted) exploitation or even enslavement of indigenous peoples. Our tendency to bracket, of course, doesn't mean that there aren't legitimate objections to such colonialist-themed games. It suggests that we have subjectively made an internal calculation about how egregious we think that the representational offense is and whether it is “worth it” to criticize the collective ludic activity of our friends.""

Food Chain Magnate,Strategically hire and manage your workforce to outcompete rival fast food chains. ,2015,2,5,"3, 4",120,240,14,4.2,Strategy ,,"Board games are tabletop games that typically use pieces. These pieces are moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing surface) and often include elements of table, card, role-playing, and miniatures games as well.
Many board games feature a competition between two or more players. To show a few examples: in checkers (British English name 'draughts'), a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces, while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team, and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person.
There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, such as in snakes and ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader. Play components now often include custom figures or shaped counters, and distinctively shaped player pieces commonly known as meeples as well as traditional cards and dice.
The time required to learn or master gameplay varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily related to the number or complexity of rules; for example, chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets but have great strategic depth.


== History ==


=== Ancient ===
Classical board games are divided into four categories: race games (such as pachisi), space games (such as noughts and crosses), chase games (such as hnefatafl), and games of displacement (such as chess).
Board games have been played, traveled, and evolved in most cultures and societies throughout history. Several important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as Jiroft civilization game boards in Iran. Senet, found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively, is the oldest board game known to have existed. Senet was pictured in a fresco painting found in Merknera's tomb (3300–2700 BC). Also from predynastic Egypt is mehen.
Hounds and jackals, another ancient Egyptian board game, appeared around 2000 BC. The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb that dates to the 13th dynasty. This game was also popular in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.
Backgammon originated in ancient Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago.  Ashtapada, chess, pachisi and chaupar originated in India. Go and liubo originated in China. Patolli originated in Mesoamerica played by the ancient Aztecs and the royal game of Ur was found in the royal tombs of Ur, dating to Mesopotamia 4,600 years ago.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== European ===

Board games have a long tradition in Europe. The oldest records of board gaming in Europe date back to Homer's Iliad (written in the 8th century BC), in which he mentions the Ancient Greek game of petteia. This game of petteia would later evolve into the Roman ludus latrunculorum. Board gaming in ancient Europe was not unique to the Greco-Roman world, with records estimating that the ancient Norse game of hnefatafl was developed sometime before 400AD. In ancient Ireland, the game of fidchell or ficheall, is said to date back to at least 144 AD, though this is likely an anachronism. A fidchell board dating from the 10th century has been uncovered in Co. Westmeath, Ireland.
The association of dice and cards with gambling led to all dice games except backgammon being treated as lotteries by dice in the gaming acts of 1710 and 1845. Early board game producers in the second half of the eighteenth century were mapmakers. The global popularization of Board Games, with special themes and branding, coincided with the formation of the global dominance of the British Empire. John Wallis was an English board game publisher, bookseller, map/chart seller, printseller, music seller, and cartographer. With his sons John Wallis Jr. and Edward Wallis, he was one of the most prolific publishers of board games of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. John Betts' A Tour of the British Colonies and Foreign Possessions and William Spooner's A Voyage of Discovery were popular in the British empire. Kriegsspiel is a genre of wargaming developed in 19th century Prussia to teach battle tactics to officers.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== American ===

The board game Travellers' Tour Through the United States and its sister game Traveller's Tour Through Europe were published by New York City bookseller F. & R. Lockwood in 1822 and claim the distinction of being the first board games published in the United States.
Margaret Hofer described the period of the 1880s–1920s as ""The Golden Age"" of board gaming in America. Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through mass production, which made them cheaper and more easily available.


=== Chinese, Arabic, and Indian ===
Outside of Europe and the U.S., many traditional board games are popular. In China, Go and many variations of chess are popular. In Africa and the Middle East, mancala is a popular board game archetype with many regional variations. In India, a community game called Carrom is popular.


=== Modern ===

In the late 1990s, companies began producing more new games to serve a growing worldwide market. In the 2010s, several publications said board games were amid a new Golden Age or ""renaissance"". Board game venues also grew  in popularity; in 2016 alone, more than 5,000 board game cafés opened in the U.S., and they were reported to be very popular in China as well. 
Board games have been used as a mechanism for science communication.


== Luck, strategy, and diplomacy ==
Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as Candy Land and snakes and ladders require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.

Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in backgammon, Monopoly, or Risk; but over many games, a skilled player will win more often. The elements of luck can also make for more excitement at times, and allow for more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered.
Luck may be introduced into a game by several methods. The use of dice of various sorts goes back to the earliest board games. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly, to how their forces fare in battle, as in Risk, or which resources a player gains, as in Catan. Other games such as Sorry! use a deck of special cards that, when shuffled, create randomness. Scrabble does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. German-style board games are notable for often having fewer elements of luck than many North American board games. Luck may be reduced in favour of skill by introducing symmetry between players. For example, in a dice game such as Ludo, by giving each player the choice of rolling the dice or using the previous player's roll.
Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players, making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, cooperative games being the exception. An important facet of Catan, for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In Risk, two or more players may team up against others. Easy diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Advanced diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game Diplomacy) consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.
In perfect information games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as Tigris and Euphrates or Stratego, some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.


== Software ==

Many board games are now available as video games. These are aptly termed digital board games, and their distinguishing characteristic compared to traditional board games is they can now be played online against a computer or other players. Some websites (such as boardgamearena.com, yucata.de, etc.) allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use email to notify the players after each move. The Internet and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed. Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or DVDs in accompaniment to the game.

There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as Vassal, Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds that are more specialized for role-playing games. Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, Fantasy Grounds has licenses for both Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder materials, while Tabletop Simulator allows game publishers to provide paid downloadable content for their games. However, as these games offer the ability to add in the content through user modifications, there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.


== Market ==

While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for video games, it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s. A 2012 article in The Guardian described board games as ""making a comeback"". Other expert sources suggest that board games never went away, and that board games have remained a popular leisure activity which has only grown over time.  Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at ""between 25% and 40% annually"" since 2010, and described the current time as the ""golden era for board games"". The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant mechanics, components, artwork, and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet. Crowd-sourcing for board games is a large facet of the market, with $233 million raised on Kickstarter in 2020.
A 1991 estimate for the global board game market was over $1.2 billion. A 2001 estimate for the United States ""board games and puzzle"" market gave a value of under $400 million, and for United Kingdom, of about £50 million. A 2009 estimate for the Korean market was put at 800 million won, and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about $800 million. A 2011 estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over 10 billion yuan. A 2013 estimate put the size of the German toy market at 2.7 billion euros (out of which the board games and puzzle market is worth about 375 million euros), and Polish markets at 2 billion and 280 million zlotys, respectively. In 2009, Germany was considered to be the best market per capita, with the highest number of games sold per individual.


=== Hobby board games ===
Some academics, such as Erica Price and Marco Arnaudo, have differentiated ""hobby"" board games and gamers from other board games and gamers. A 2014 estimate placed the U.S. and Canada market for hobby board games (games produced for a ""gamer"" market) at only $75 million, with the total size of what it defined as the ""hobby game market"" (""the market for those games regardless of whether they're sold in the hobby channel or other channels,"") at over $700 million. A similar 2015 estimate suggested a hobby game market value of almost $900 million.


== Research ==

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as game studies or ludology.
While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess, Go, mancala), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk, and especially modern board games such as Catan, Agricola, and Pandemic. Much research has been carried out on chess, partly because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, Herbert A. Simon, and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing ability.
Linearly arranged board games have improved children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a number line in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.
Research studies show that board games such as Snakes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation, and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece. Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's executive functions and help reduce risks of dementia for the elderly. Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility, culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities.

Additionally, board games can be therapeutic. Bruce Halpenny, a games inventor said when interviewed about his game, The Great Train Robbery:With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player's imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble, they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society because most jobs are boring and repetitive.
Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to the traditional educational curriculum if the content is appropriate and the gameplay informs students on the curriculum content.


== Categories ==
There are several ways in which board games can be classified, and considerable overlap may exist, so that a game belongs to several categories.
The namesake of the board game, gameboards would seem to be a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre, though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards (as well as games that use neither cards nor a gameboard) are often colloquially included, with some scholars therefore referring to said genre as that of ""table and board games"" or ""tabletop games"", or seeing board games as a subgenre or tabletop games.: 5 : 1 
H. J. R. Murray's A History of Board Games Other Than Chess (1952) has been called the first attempt to develop a ""scheme for the classification of board games"". David Parlett's Oxford History of Board Games (1999) defines four primary categories: race games (where the goal is to be the first to move all one's pieces to the final destination), space games (in which the object is to arrange the pieces into some special configuration), chase games (asymmetrical games, where players start the game with different sets of pieces and objectives) and displace games (where the main objective is the capture the opponents' pieces). Parlett also distinguishes between abstract and thematic games, the latter having a specific theme or frame narrative (ex. regular chess versus, for example, Star Wars-themed chess).

The following is a list of some of the most common game categories:


== Glossary ==

Although many board games have a jargon all their own, there is a generalized terminology to describe concepts applicable to basic game mechanics and attributes common to nearly all board games.

Caverna: The Cave Farmers,"From a simple cave, expand your dwarven home through mining, agriculture, and more.",2013,1,7,4,30,210,12,3.79,Strategy ,,"Agricola is a Euro-style board game created by Uwe Rosenberg. It is a worker placement game with a focus on resource management. In Agricola, players are farmers who sow, plow the fields, collect wood, build stables, buy animals, expand their farms and feed their families. After 14 rounds players calculate their score based on the size and prosperity of the household.
The game was published by Lookout Games and released at Spiel 2007, where it was voted second-best game shown at the convention, according to the Fairplay in-show voting. The game was released in English by Z-Man Games in July 2008. Playdek released an iOS conversion of the game in June 2013. A second edition of Agricola was published by Mayfair Games in May 2016.
Agricola won the Spiel des Jahres special award for ""Best complex game 2008"" and the 2008 Deutscher Spiele Preis.
It was also the game that ended Puerto Rico's run of more than five years as the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek, staying at the top of the rankings between September 2008 and March 2010. As of September 2021, Agricola is ranked 49th among all board games on BoardGameGeek, with the revised edition being ranked 75th.
A two-player version called Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.


== Gameplay ==

Players start the game with a farming couple living in a two-roomed hut. Each round, they take turns placing their family members in action spaces to get resources and improve and grow their households. Only one family member can occupy each action space within the same round, so players need to time their actions to get maximum profit while denying progress to the opponents.
The game is played in 14 rounds, divided by 6 harvests, occurring after rounds 4,7,9,11,13, and 14. At each harvest, food is grown, people are fed, and animals multiply. Players lose victory points if they have trouble feeding their family, which makes food production a major point of tension in the game.
At the end of round 14 comes the final harvest after which victory points are counted. Scoring in Agricola rewards a middle-of-the-road strategy. Players are penalized for focusing on any one aspect of the game, and stop scoring in any area they focus on too much. The player with the most balanced and prosperous farm wins.


=== Optional cards ===
To achieve variation between games, players are dealt a hand of optional cards – occupations and minor improvements. Players get additional resources and various bonuses for playing these cards. They can also get an initial direction for their strategy, based on the occupations and improvements they were dealt. Numerous expansion decks have been released to fill in gaps in gameplay and add thematic settings. The game offers a simplified 'family' variation for less involved players, in which occupation and minor improvement cards are not used.


== Differences in the revised edition ==

The original Agricola used multicolored wooden pieces of the same circular shape to denote various resources (clay, wood, reeds, etc.). The 2016 edition offered shaped wooden pieces for resources that make it easier to differentiate between the many types of resources. The new edition also included fewer optional cards – two decks for a total of 96 cards (as opposed to three decks with 308 cards in the original edition). Some reviewers praised the balance of the new decks. The revised edition is a 1-4 player game, as opposed to the original version's player count of 1–5. However, there is a 5-6 player expansion for the revised edition.


== Reimplementation ==
Rosenberg has reimplemented many mechanics from Agricola in later boardgames, in particular, Caverna (2013) and a two-player version Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small.

The Kinderspiel des Jahres is awarded annually to the best children's game by a jury of German game critics. This award is to children's games what the Spiel des Jahres is to family games.
2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was a subcategory of the Spiel des Jahres awards known as the Sonderpreis ""Kinderspiel"" (""Special Prize for Best Children's Game""). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989–2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres.

Blood Rage,Ragnar?k has come! Secure your place in Valhalla in epic Viking battles.,2015,2,4,4,60,90,14,2.88,Strategy ,,"Blood Rage is a Viking themed board game designed by Eric Lang and published by CMON Limited in 2015. Each player controls a clan of mythological Vikings seeking glory as Ragnarok approaches. Played in three ages or rounds, Blood Rage features card drafting, battles and territory control via forces represented by sculpted plastic miniatures. All conflicts are resolved through playing cards, and cards are also used to improve and differentiate the different clans and the leaders, warriors, ships and monsters at their command.
Based in part on Lang's 2007 design Midgard, the game was originally released on Kickstarter, raising just under $1 million. The game was well received, landing on the recommended list for the 2015 Kennerspiel des Jahres award for strategy game of the year.


== Gameplay ==
At the beginning of each of the game's three ages or rounds, each player is dealt eight cards, keeping one and passing the rest to the player on their left, until players have six cards. There are cards which give bonuses in battle, upgrades which give special abilities to a player's forces or allow players to recruit monsters to fight on their behalf, and quests give short term victory point objectives. Each player's clan of Viking forces begins the same, but quickly differentiates itself based on the drafted cards.
After drafting cards, each player takes turns sequentially, using the game's resource, Rage, to perform actions. These include upgrading a clan's abilities and forces, having those forces invade the map, or pillaging provinces. Pillaging further improves one's clan and scores points, and can lead to battles with other players. Battles are resolved without luck - players secretly play a card and add that to the strength of their forces in that region to determine the winner.
At the end of each age, a portion of the board is removed as Ragnarok approaches, sending any forces on that part of the map to Valhalla and earning players glory (victory points) for each of their forces that were thus destroyed. The game supports a variety of different strategies depending on which cards the players draft, from controlling territories, winning battles, or even having one's own forces be destroyed, if a player has drafted cards that give points and bonuses for being defeated.
In strategies and mechanics, the game merges the traditions of American style games and eurogames, combining the conflict and strong theme prevalent in the former with the statistics, upgrades and lack of chance common in the latter.


== Release and Reception ==
Blood Rage was originally inspired by Lang's 2007 design Midgard. The game was launched on Kickstarter by CMON in March 2015 and delivered in November, and which point the game became widely available. One of the most publicized Kickstarter campaigns for designer board games of the year, the game was sold through Kickstarter to almost 10,000 backers, generating revenues of almost $1 million.
Blood Rage has received consistently positive reviews. Writing for Ars Technica, Aaron Zimmerman praised the card driving system allowing strategic depth and the lack of randomness in the ""diceless, card-driven combat"" system, and concluding that it was ""a ton of fun"". Ben Guarino from Inverse also commented on the swiftness of the game rounds, strategic combinations enabled by the card drafting, and tension. The components, including the plastic miniatures which represented, the mythical monsters and Viking soldiers which battle on behalf of the players, were also met with positive reception.  Charlie Theel for Ars Technica latter said that Blood Rage ""confirmed Eric Lang as one of the preeminent modern board gaming designers."" The game was also on the recommended list for the 2015 Kennerspiel des Jahres award.
In 2019 CMON ran a Kickstarter campaign for a digital version of the game, which cost $15.

Blood Rage Review on Dice Tower"
Agricola,Build your farmstead by sowing fields and raising livestock. But don't forget to eat!,2007,1,5,"3, 4",30,150,12,3.64,Strategy ,,"Agricola is a Euro-style board game created by Uwe Rosenberg. It is a worker placement game with a focus on resource management. In Agricola, players are farmers who sow, plow the fields, collect wood, build stables, buy animals, expand their farms and feed their families. After 14 rounds players calculate their score based on the size and prosperity of the household.
The game was published by Lookout Games and released at Spiel 2007, where it was voted second-best game shown at the convention, according to the Fairplay in-show voting. The game was released in English by Z-Man Games in July 2008. Playdek released an iOS conversion of the game in June 2013. A second edition of Agricola was published by Mayfair Games in May 2016.
Agricola won the Spiel des Jahres special award for ""Best complex game 2008"" and the 2008 Deutscher Spiele Preis.
It was also the game that ended Puerto Rico's run of more than five years as the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek, staying at the top of the rankings between September 2008 and March 2010. As of September 2021, Agricola is ranked 49th among all board games on BoardGameGeek, with the revised edition being ranked 75th.
A two-player version called Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.


== Gameplay ==

Players start the game with a farming couple living in a two-roomed hut. Each round, they take turns placing their family members in action spaces to get resources and improve and grow their households. Only one family member can occupy each action space within the same round, so players need to time their actions to get maximum profit while denying progress to the opponents.
The game is played in 14 rounds, divided by 6 harvests, occurring after rounds 4,7,9,11,13, and 14. At each harvest, food is grown, people are fed, and animals multiply. Players lose victory points if they have trouble feeding their family, which makes food production a major point of tension in the game.
At the end of round 14 comes the final harvest after which victory points are counted. Scoring in Agricola rewards a middle-of-the-road strategy. Players are penalized for focusing on any one aspect of the game, and stop scoring in any area they focus on too much. The player with the most balanced and prosperous farm wins.


=== Optional cards ===
To achieve variation between games, players are dealt a hand of optional cards – occupations and minor improvements. Players get additional resources and various bonuses for playing these cards. They can also get an initial direction for their strategy, based on the occupations and improvements they were dealt. Numerous expansion decks have been released to fill in gaps in gameplay and add thematic settings. The game offers a simplified 'family' variation for less involved players, in which occupation and minor improvement cards are not used.


== Differences in the revised edition ==

The original Agricola used multicolored wooden pieces of the same circular shape to denote various resources (clay, wood, reeds, etc.). The 2016 edition offered shaped wooden pieces for resources that make it easier to differentiate between the many types of resources. The new edition also included fewer optional cards – two decks for a total of 96 cards (as opposed to three decks with 308 cards in the original edition). Some reviewers praised the balance of the new decks. The revised edition is a 1-4 player game, as opposed to the original version's player count of 1–5. However, there is a 5-6 player expansion for the revised edition.


== Reimplementation ==
Rosenberg has reimplemented many mechanics from Agricola in later boardgames, in particular, Caverna (2013) and a two-player version Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small.

Maracaibo,Seafarers journey to obtain wealth and fame in the 17th century Caribbean.,2019,1,4,3,30,120,12,3.89,Strategy ,,"The Deutscher Spielepreis (German: [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃpiːləˌpʁaɪs], German Game Prize) (DSP) is an important award for boardgames. It was started in 1990 by the German magazine Die Pöppel-Revue, which collects votes from the industry's  stores, magazines, professionals and game clubs. The results are announced every October at the Spiel game fair in Essen, Germany. The Essen Feather is awarded at the same ceremony.
In contrast to the Spiel des Jahres, which tends to be awarded to family games, the DSP is awarded for ""gamers' games"" with particularly good or innovative gameplay. Although at one point it was not uncommon for the DSP and the SdJ to be awarded to the same game (as was the case for The Settlers of Catan, El Grande, and Tikal in the 1990s), since Carcassonne (2001) only two games have succeeded in winning both awards: Dominion in 2009 and Azul in 2018.

Pandemic Legacy: Season 2,The world is a mystery after a devastating pandemic—where will your team go?,2017,2,4,4,60,60,14,3.23,Strategy,  Thematic,"A legacy game is a variant of tabletop board games in which the game itself is designed, through various mechanics, to change permanently over the course of a series of sessions.


== History ==
Game designer Rob Daviau claims to have come up with the idea at a work meeting after jokingly asking why the murderous characters in Clue are always invited back to dinner. Realizing that each new game resets, Daviau thought about what it would be like if everyone would remember who the murderer was, and he pitched the idea of a Clue legacy game to Hasbro.

While that idea was rejected, Daviau was later asked to use the mechanic in a new version of Risk. Risk Legacy was released in 2011 and was his first game to use this format.
Daviau followed up with an award-winning Pandemic variant, Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, which was released in 2015 to positive reviews and praised as a leap forward in modern board game design. Daviau continues to develop legacy games and co-developed a mechanic, the Echo System, to retain permanent changes through subsequent games in a franchise.
Daviau cited his work on Betrayal at House on the Hill (which was later adapted into a legacy version) and Trivial Pursuit: DVD – Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition as predecessors to the legacy idea. The latter was designed in such a way that pre-programmed games sorted the cards by difficulty. This caused some vocal backlash as the game was perceived by many to have a more definite end than other versions.


== Common mechanics and themes ==
Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. As such they have been compared to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. New rules can be introduced as the campaign goes on, allowing for the game to expand both mechanically and thematically. Games can use the expanding campaign as a mode of storytelling; Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 uses a three-act structure to tell its story. Daviau describes legacy games as ""experiential"" in contrast to traditional games, which are ""repeatable"". He compared his legacy games to that of a concert where you ""buy a ticket for an experience"" while Haoran Un of Kotaku describes the idea as ""avant-garde performance art"".
Legacy games break certain covenants that players expect from traditional board games. Permanent, physical changes can occur to components based on game outcomes and player choices. For instance players might be instructed to write names on cards, place stickers on the game board, or destroy some components. This causes each copy of the game to be unique at the end and has earned the legacy genre criticism in that there is a finite amount of replayability. Some games have been designed to be replayable with refill packs or non-permanent stickers while others are still playable with the final permanent changes once the campaign is over.

Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar,"Lead your people, build monuments and make offerings to earn the favour of the gods.",2012,2,4,4,90,90,13,3.67,Strategy,,"The Deutscher Spielepreis (German: [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃpiːləˌpʁaɪs], German Game Prize) (DSP) is an important award for boardgames. It was started in 1990 by the German magazine Die Pöppel-Revue, which collects votes from the industry's  stores, magazines, professionals and game clubs. The results are announced every October at the Spiel game fair in Essen, Germany. The Essen Feather is awarded at the same ceremony.
In contrast to the Spiel des Jahres, which tends to be awarded to family games, the DSP is awarded for ""gamers' games"" with particularly good or innovative gameplay. Although at one point it was not uncommon for the DSP and the SdJ to be awarded to the same game (as was the case for The Settlers of Catan, El Grande, and Tikal in the 1990s), since Carcassonne (2001) only two games have succeeded in winning both awards: Dominion in 2009 and Azul in 2018.

Power Grid,"Bid, network, and manage resources in a race to supply the most cities with power. ",2004,2,6,"4, 5",120,120,12,3.27,Strategy,,"A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game, (generally just referred to as board games in Europe) is a class of tabletop games that generally has indirect player interaction and multiple ways to score points. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit.


== History ==

Due in part to postwar aversion to products which glorified conflict, the 3M series of strategy and economic games, including Acquire, became popular in Germany and provided a template for a new form of gameplay without direct conflict or warfare. 


=== German family board games ===
The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany. The genre has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Settlers of Catan, first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe.
Though neither the first Eurogame nor the first such game to find an audience outside Germany, it became much more popular than any of its predecessors. It quickly sold millions of copies in Germany, and in the process brought money and attention to the genre as a whole.


=== 21st century ===
Germany purchased more board games per capita than any other country as of 2009. While many Eurogames are published and played in Anglophone markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, and Alhambra.


== Characteristics ==

Eurogames tend to be focused on challenge for players. They feature economics and the acquisition of resources rather than direct conflict, and have a limited amount of luck. They also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict. Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the wargames that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as SPI and Avalon Hill, but nonetheless often have a considerable depth of play.
One consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as Puerto Rico that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like Terra Mystica and Tzolkin being significantly more difficult to master.


=== Incentive for social play ===

While many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, Eurogames are, for the most part, well-suited to social play. In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. In contrast to games such as Risk or Monopoly, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a pre-determined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources.  Playing time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. Generally Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge; although there is a sizeable body of German-style games that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate anywhere from two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare, with Power Grid and Caverna (the latter supporting seven player games) being two examples, or require expansions, as with The Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. Players usually play for themselves individually, rather than in a partnership or team.
A growing number of Eurogames support solo play with modified rulesets. To win, the player either has to achieve specific single-player campaign goals or beat the score of a simulated opponent that takes actions according to special rules outlined in the scenario. Recent Eurogames suitable for solo play include Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island.


=== No player elimination ===
Another prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination.  Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games.  Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game. Related to no-player-elimination, Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead. A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing. Balancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders. This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end, an example of which is Power Grid, where the turn order is determined by number of cities (and biggest power plant as the tie-breaker), such that players further ahead are handicapped in their option of plays.


=== Game mechanics ===
A wide variety of often innovative mechanisms or mechanics are used, and familiar mechanics such as rolling dice and moving, capture, or trick taking are avoided. If a game has a board, the board is usually irregular rather than uniform or symmetric (such as Risk rather than chess or Scrabble). The board is often random (as in The Settlers of Catan) or has random elements (such as Tikal). Some boards are merely mnemonic or organizational and contribute only to ease of play, such as a cribbage board; examples of this include Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence. Random elements are often present but do not usually dominate the game. While rules are light to moderate, they allow depth of play, usually requiring thought, planning, and a shift of tactics through the game and featuring a chess- or backgammon-like opening game, middle game, and end game.
Stewart Woods' Eurogames cites six examples of mechanics common to eurogames:

Tile Placement – spatial placement of game components on the playing board.
Auctions – includes open and hidden auctions of both resources and actions from other players and the game system itself.
Trading/Negotiation – not simply trading resources of equivalent values, but allowing players to set markets.
Set Collection – collecting resources in specific groups that are then cashed in for points or other currency.
Area Control – also known as area majority or influence, this involves controlling a game element or board space through allocation of resources.
Worker Placement or Role Selection – players choose specific game actions in sequential order, with players disallowed from choosing a previously selected action.


=== Low randomness ===

Eurogame designs tend to de-emphasize luck and random elements. Often, the only random element of the game will be resource or terrain distribution in the initial setup, or (less frequently) the random order of a set of event or objective cards. The role played by deliberately random mechanics in other styles of game is instead fulfilled by the unpredictability of the behavior of other players.


=== Themes ===
Examples of themes are:

Carcassonne – build a medieval landscape complete with walled cities, monasteries, roads, and fields.
Puerto Rico – develop plantations on the island of Puerto Rico, set in the 18th century.
Power Grid – expand a power company's network and buy better plants.
Imperial – as an international investor, influence the politics of pre-World War I European empires.
Bruxelles 1893 – take the role of an Art Nouveau architect during the late 19th century and try to become the most famous architect in Belgium.


=== Game designer as author ===
Although not relevant to actual play, the name of the game's designer is often prominently mentioned on the box, or at least in the rule book. Top designers enjoy considerable following among enthusiasts of Eurogames. For this reason, the name ""designer games"" is often offered as a description of the genre. Recently, there has also been a wave of games designed as spin-offs of popular novels, such as the games taking their style from the German bestsellers Der Schwarm and Tintenherz.


== Industry ==


=== Designers ===

Designers of Eurogames include:

Antoine Bauza, a prolific French designer, creator of 7 Wonders, Tokaido, and Takenoko.
Bruno Cathala, a French-born game designer, creator of Kingdomino and Five Tribes.
Vlaada Chvátil, a Czech designer of board games and video games, whose games include Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, Galaxy Trucker, Space Alert, and Codenames.  His rule books are often divided into several ""learning scenarios"" that gradually introduce players to the rules as they progress through the scenarios.
Leo Colovini, designer of Cartagena and Carcassonne: The Discovery.
Rüdiger Dorn, a German designer who created Istanbul, Karuba, Las Vegas, Luxor, and others.
Bruno Faidutti, French designer of Citadels.
Stefan Feld, designer particularly of games that make use of dice, and that allow players to score points in a variety of ways. He has designed games such as Castles of Burgundy and Trajan, and three of his games (Strasbourg, Bruges, and Carpe Diem) have been nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres.
Friedemann Friese, a German designer, creator of Power Grid, as well as many others.
Mac Gerdts, a German designer of games such as Antike, Imperial, Navegador, and Concordia.
Reiner Knizia, one of the most prolific German game designers, having designed over 600 published games. Recurring mechanisms in his games include auctions (Ra and Modern Art), tile placement (Tigris and Euphrates and Ingenious), and intricate scoring rules (Samurai). He has also designed many card games such as Lost Cities, Schotten-Totten, and Blue Moon, and the cooperative board game The Lord of the Rings.
Wolfgang Kramer, who often works with other game designers. His titles include El Grande, Tikal, Princes of Florence, and Torres. His games often have some sort of action point system, and include some geometric element.
Alan R. Moon, a British-born designer with numerous games to his credit, often with a railway theme, including the Spiel des Jahres-winning Ticket to Ride and Elfenland.
Alex Randolph, who created over 125 games and is responsible for the placement of the author's name on the rules and box.
Uwe Rosenberg, designer of games such as Agricola, Le Havre, Patchwork, and several others.
Sid Sackson was a prolific American game designer whose games, particularly Acquire, prefigured and strongly influenced the Eurogame genre.
Michael Schacht, German designer of Coloretto, Zooloretto, Aquaretto, Valdora, Africana, Web of power, China, Han, Hansa, Mondo, Mondo Sapiens, Spirits of the Forest, Coney Island.
Andreas Seyfarth, who has designed the games Puerto Rico, Manhattan, and, with Karen Seyfarth, Thurn and Taxis.
Klaus Teuber, designer of Catan, which has sold more than 22 million copies.
Klaus-Jürgen Wrede, the German game designer of the Carcassonne board game series. As of April 2023, Carcassonne has 11 expansions and 6 variant standalone games available as well as numerous mini-expansions.


=== Events ===

The Internationale Spieltage, also known as Essen Spiel, or the Essen Games Fair, is the largest non-digital game convention in the world, and the place where the largest number of Eurogames are released each year. Founded in 1983 and held annually in Essen, Germany, the fair was founded with the objective of providing a venue for people to meet and play board games, and show gaming as an integral part of German culture.
A ""World Boardgaming Championships"" is held annually in July in Pennsylvania, USA.  The event is nine days long and includes tournament tracks of over a hundred games; while traditional wargames are played there, all of the most popular tournaments are Eurogames and it is generally perceived as a Eurogame-centered event.  Attendance is international, though players from the U.S. and Canada predominate.


=== Awards ===
The most prestigious German board game award is the Spiel des Jahres (""Game of the Year""). The award is very family-oriented, with shorter, more approachable games such as Ticket to Ride and Elfenland usually preferred by the committee that gives out the award.
In 2011, the jury responsible for the Spiel des Jahres created the Kennerspiel des Jahres, or connoisseur's game of the year, for more complex games.
The Deutscher Spiele Preis (""German game prize"") is also awarded to games that are more complex and strategic, such as Puerto Rico. However, there are a few games with broad enough appeal to win both awards: The Settlers of Catan (1995), Carcassonne (2001), Dominion (2009).


== Influence ==
Xbox Live Arcade has included popular games from the genre, with Catan being released to strong sales on May 13, 2007, Carcassonne being released on June 27, 2007. Lost Cities and Ticket to Ride soon followed. Alhambra was due to follow later in 2007 until being cancelled.
The iPhone received versions of The Settlers of Catan and Zooloretto in 2009. Carcassonne was added to the iPhone App Store in June 2010. Later, Ticket to Ride was developed for both the iPhone and the iPad, significantly boosting sales of the board game.

Kingdom Death: Monster,Try to survive in a nightmarish world that lies under eternal darkness.,2015,1,4,4,60,180,17,4.26,Thematic,,"Diplomacy is a strategic board game created by Allan B. Calhamer in 1954 and released commercially in the United States in 1959. Its main distinctions from most board wargames are its negotiation phases (players spend much of their time forming and betraying alliances with other players and forming beneficial strategies) and the absence of dice and other game elements that produce random effects. Set in Europe in the years leading to the First World War, Diplomacy is played by two to seven players, each controlling the armed forces of a major European power (or, with fewer players, multiple powers). Each player aims to move their few starting units and defeat those of others to win possession of a majority of strategic cities and provinces marked as ""supply centers"" on the map; these supply centers allow players who control them to produce more units. Following each round of player negotiations, each player can issue attack and support orders, which are then executed during the movement phase. A player takes control of a province when the number of provinces that are given orders to support the attacking province exceeds the number of provinces given orders to support the defending province.
Diplomacy was the first commercially published game to be played by mail (PBM); only chess, which is in the public domain, saw significant postal play earlier. Diplomacy was also the first commercially published game to generate an active hobby scene with amateur fanzines; only science-fiction, fantasy and comics fandom saw fanzines earlier. Competitive face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments have been held since the 1970s. Play of Diplomacy by e-mail (PBEM) has been widespread since the late 1980s.
Diplomacy has been published in the United States by Games Research, Avalon Hill, and Hasbro; the name is currently a registered trademark of Hasbro's Avalon Hill division. Diplomacy has also been licensed to various companies for publication in other countries. Diplomacy is also played on the Internet, adjudicated by a computer or a human gamemaster.


== History ==
The idea for Diplomacy arose from Allan B. Calhamer's study at Harvard of nineteenth-century European history under Sidney B. Fay and from his study of political geography. Calhamer also drew inspiration from the card game of Hearts, in which he observed that players were at an advantage when they teamed up against the leader, and from the game of chess, which inspired him to use a limited number of spaces and pieces.
The rough form of Diplomacy was created in 1954, and its details were developed through playtesting until the 1958 map and rules revisions. Calhamer paid for a 500-game print run of that version in 1959 after rejection by major companies. It has been published since then by Games Research (in 1961, then a 1971 edition with a revised rulebook), Avalon Hill (in 1976), by Hasbro's Avalon Hill division (in 1999), and now by Wizards of the Coast (in 2008) in the US, and licensed to other boardgame publishers for versions sold in other countries. Among these are Parker Brothers, Waddingtons Games, Gibsons Games, and Asmodée Editions.
The first copy of the first print run was sold by the Calhamer estate through auction in 2017. 


== Basic setting and overview ==
The board is a map of 1901 Europe plus Turkey, Syria and North Africa. It is divided into fifty-six land regions and nineteen sea regions. Forty-two of the land regions are divided among the seven Great Powers of the game: Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.  The remaining fourteen land regions are neutral at the start of the game.
Thirty-four of the land regions contain ""supply centers"", corresponding to major centers of government, industry or commerce (e.g., Vienna and Rome); twenty-two of these are located within the Great Powers and are referred to as ""home"" supply centers. The remaining twelve are located in the neutral provinces. The number of supply centers a player controls determines the total number of armies and fleets a player may have on the board, and as players gain and lose control of centers, they may build (raise) or must remove (disband) units correspondingly.

The land provinces within the Great Powers which contain supply centers are generally named after a major city in the province (e.g. London and Moscow) while the other land provinces within the Great Powers are generally named after a region (e.g. Bohemia and Apulia). Neutral land provinces are generally named after countries (e.g. Serbia and Belgium).
All players other than Britain and Russia begin the game with two armies and one fleet; Britain starts with two fleets and one army, and Russia starts with two armies and two fleets, making it the only player to start the game with more than three units. Only one unit at a time may occupy a given map region. Balancing units to supply center counts is done after each game-year, which involves two seasons of play: Spring and Fall.
At the beginning of the game, the twelve neutral supply centers are typically captured within the first few moves. Further acquisition of supply centers becomes a zero sum dynamic with any gains in a player's resources coming at the expense of a rival.


== Historicity ==
Although the game starts in 1901, the map generally reflects the political boundaries of Europe in 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War. Bosnia is already annexed to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Balkans reflect the results of the wars of 1912 and 1913 in the region.
On the other hand, Montenegro is shown as part of Austria-Hungary. Additionally, North Africa and Tunis start the game as neutral, despite these regions being part of the French colonial empire in 1914. Finland and Syria are both parts of Great Powers, as Finland was part of the Russian Empire, and Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire in 1914. Tunis is used rather than Tunisia on most boards. North Africa is a single province covering parts of Algeria and Morocco.


== Comparison with other war games ==
Diplomacy differs from the majority of war games because:

Players do not take turns sequentially; instead all players secretly write down their moves after a negotiation period, then all moves are revealed and put into effect simultaneously.
Social interaction and interpersonal skills make up an essential part of the play.
The rules that simulate combat are strategic, abstract, and simple—not tactical, realistic, or complex—as this is a diplomatic simulation game, not a military one.
Combat resolution contains no random elements—no dice are rolled or cards drawn.
Each military unit has the same strength.
It is especially well suited to postal play, which led to an active hobby of amateur publishing.
Internet Diplomacy is one of the few early board games that is still played on the web.
The game board is on the scale of an entire continent, rather than a single campaign theater.
Land and sea power are almost equally significant, and a player's decision as to whether to raise an army or a fleet is highly significant.


== Gameplay ==
Diplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the ""Spring"" and ""Fall"" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by ""retreat"" or ""disband"" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.


=== Negotiation phase ===
In the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.
Communication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.


=== Movement phase ===
After the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a ""convoy"". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).
Certain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.


=== End-of-year and supply centers ===
After each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw – around half of all games will end in a draw.


== Variants ==
Several boardgames based on Diplomacy have been commercially published. Additionally, many fans of the game have created hundreds of variants of their own, using altered rules on the standard map, standard rules on a different map, or both.


=== Rulebook provision for fewer than seven players ===
The rules allow for games with two to six players, closing parts of the standard board, but these are used only in casual play, and are not considered standard Diplomacy in tournament, postal, or most forms of online play. For example, if there are six players, everyone plays one country and Italy is not used; for five players, Italy and Germany are not used. The original rules did not include additional guidelines, but the Avalon Hill set included suggestions, such as individual players using multiple countries, and additions.
Another approach to solving the problem of fewer than seven players is the use of the Escalation Variant Rules by Edi Birsan:

Players start with no pieces on the board
Players put one piece down on the board in any province one at a time (starting with the youngest player)
After reaching the maximum number of pieces the players start the game with ownership of their starting provinces.
At the end of Fall 1901 with their adjustments players write down their three HOME centers for the rest of the game.
This is done without negotiations and may result in two players declaring the same province. However, in order to build there they still must own it and the province must be open. Players may choose any supply center as a HOME for example: EDI, DEN, ROM
It is suggested that for the number players the following starting pieces are used:

Two – 12 units
Three – 8 units
Four − 6 units
Five – 5 units
Six – 4 units
It is also suggested that for games with 2–4 players that the 'Gunboat' rule applies which means that there are no discussions.
For 4 or 5 players, it is suggested that the 'Wilson' or 'Public Press' rule applies which means that all discussions must take place in the open at the table with no whispers or secret signals.
For 5 or 6 players, it is suggested that regular negotiation rules apply.
The following are the current official suggestions:


==== Alternative way to play ====
The following is an alternative way to play the game of Diplomacy when fewer than seven players are present.

Six Players
Eliminate Italy. Italian units hold in position and defend themselves, but don't support each other. Units belonging to any of the players can support them in their holding position. If Italian units are forced to retreat, they're disbanded.
Five Players
Eliminate Italy and Germany (as described for Italy above).
Four Players
One player plays Britain, and the other three play the following pairs: Austria/France, Germany/Turkey, and Italy/Russia.
Three Players
One player controls Britain/Germany/Austria; the second, Russia/Italy; and the third, France/Turkey. Or one player plays Britain/Austria; one plays France/Russia; one plays Germany/Turkey. In this version Italy is not played.
Three Players (alternative)
One person plays Russia while the other two control Britain/France/Germany and Austria/Italy/Turkey.
Two Players
This version can be played as a World War I simulation. One player controls Britain/France/Russia while the other plays Austria/Germany/Turkey. Italy is neutral and Italian territory can't be entered. The game begins in 1914. Before the Fall 1914 adjustments, flip a coin. Italy joins the winner of the toss in Spring 1915. The first player to control 24 supply centers wins. This is also a way for two new players to learn the rules.
In games for two, three, or four players, supply-center ownership is computed for each individual country, even though the same person plays more than one country. As with the regular rules, adjustments must be made by each country in accordance with its supply-center holdings.


=== Commercially published Diplomacy variants ===
There have been six commercially released variants of Diplomacy — Machiavelli, Kamakura, Colonial Diplomacy, Hundred, Ard-Rí and Classical. Imperial is a boardgame with enough similarities to be described as a Diplomacy variant by some.


==== Machiavelli ====

Machiavelli was published by Battleline Publications, later taken over by Avalon Hill. Set in Renaissance Italy, the board is controlled by the Republic of Florence, the Republic of Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, the Papacy, Valois France, Habsburg Austria, and the Ottoman Turks. The game introduces many rules changes such as money, bribery, three seasons per year, garrisons, and random events such as plague and famine. It features scenarios tailored for as few as four and as many as eight players.


==== Kamakura ====
Kamakura was published by West End Games in the early 1980s. Its setting is feudal Japan.


==== Colonial Diplomacy ====
Published by Avalon Hill in 1994. It is set in Asia in the late 19th century, and much of the board is controlled by various colonial powers: the United Kingdom, the Russian Empire, the Empire of Japan, Holland, Ottoman Empire, China, and France. The game introduces three special features:

The Trans-Siberian railroad extends across Russia from Moscow to Vladivostok. The railroad can be used by Russia to move armies anywhere along the railroad. The TSR may only be used by Russia. Russian armies are allowed to move through other Russian armies, but foreign armies can block the passage of armies on the TSR.
The Suez Canal is the only way to move between the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea. Use of the Suez Canal is controlled by whoever is in control of  Egypt. The use of the Suez Canal increases in importance later in the game as expansion becomes both more important and more difficult.
The ownership of Hong Kong counts as a supply center for any country except China.
This map was used as the basis of the Imperial Asia expansion map.
Colonial Diplomacy won in a tie the Origins Award for Best Pre-20th Century Board Game of 1995.


==== Hundred ====
Hundred is a map for three players by Andy D. Schwarz based on the Hundred Years' War created in 1996 and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Ard-Rí ====
Ard-Rí is a map by Stuart John Bernard based on pre-Christian Ireland (though it anachronistically includes Vikings), created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000. Ard-Rí happens to also be the name of a hnefatafl variant played in Ancient Ireland.


==== Classical ====
Classical is a map by Andy D. Schwarz and Vincent Mous based on the ancient world after the death of Alexander the Great, created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Diplomacy of the Three Kingdoms ====
Based on the Three Kingdoms in Ancient China, it was created by Edi Birsan to introduce the basic ideas of the main game to a Chinese audience with a setting more close to their own historical experience. It was published by MJS Creations in 2008.


=== Diplomacy variants not commercially published ===
A wide range of other variants of Diplomacy have been created and played without being commercially published. These include settings such as the ancient and renaissance world. Some variants use new maps and rules, while others simply vary the original game, such as the Fleet Rome variant which replaces the starting Italian army in Rome with a fleet.


==== Youngstown ====
One of the most notable non-commercially published is the Youngstown variant which is an extension of the normal map, including Asia and colonies there. For example, in addition to the usual home centers, France starts with a fleet in Saigon (in Cochinchina). Three new Powers were added – India, China, and Japan - with powers without historical Asian colonies being given more home centers. The variant was named after the city of Youngstown, Ohio where the variant was invented.


== Tournaments ==

Diplomacy is played at a number of formal tournaments in many nations. Most face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments longer than one day are associated with either a Diplomacy-centered convention (such as DipCon or Dixiecon) or a large multi-game convention (such as the Origins Game Fair or the World Boardgaming Championships). Some conventions are centered on the games and have a highly competitive atmosphere; others have more focus on meeting and socializing with other players from the postal or e-mail parts of the hobby.


=== Tournament play ===
In some tournaments, each game ends after a specified number of game-years, to ensure that all players can play in all rounds without limiting the tournament structure to one round per day. At other events, a game continues until a winner is determined or a draw is voted. Tournaments in Europe are generally played with a specific end year whereas tournaments in North America more often are played until someone wins or a draw is agreed.


=== Major championship tournaments ===
The World Diplomacy Convention (WDC or World DipCon) is held annually in different places in the world. The winner of WDC is considered to be the World Champion of Diplomacy. WDC was first held in 1988 in Birmingham, England, and was held at two-year intervals before becoming an annual event. WDC's site moves among four regions: North America, Europe, Australasia, and the rest of the world, with a requirement that successive WDC's are always held in different regions.
The North American Diplomacy Convention (DipCon) is held annually in different places in North America, to determine the North American Champion of Diplomacy. DipCon was first held in 1966 in Youngstown, Ohio. DipCon's site rotates among West, Central, and East regions.
The European Diplomacy Convention (Euro DipCon) is held annually in different places in Europe, to determine the European Champion of Diplomacy.
Over a dozen other countries hold face-to-face national championship tournaments.


=== Other major face-to-face tournaments ===
Many of the larger multi-game conventions, such as the World Boardgaming Championships, Gen Con, Origins, ManorCon, TempleCon, and Dragonflight also host Diplomacy tournaments. On occasion, WDC or DipCon will be held in conjunction with one of these conventions.
In addition, many of the larger local and regional clubs host tournaments on an annual basis and always encourage visitors from the local area as well as any travelers from around the globe.


=== Major play-by-email tournaments ===
The play-by-email field is constantly changing. There are numerous tournaments generally associated with different websites. As of 2008 there were no official events sanctioned by the manufacturer (Wizards/Avalon Hill). There have been and continue to be events with various sizes and self designated titles such as:

World Masters – every two years in the Worldmasters E-mail Tournament composed of both team and individual events
Diplomacy World Cup – modeled after a Soccer World Cup (players are in teams competing by countries), there have been two world cups so far and a third is under way. The first took place 2007-9 and was won by France, the second 2010-12 and was won by Ireland, and the third version started in January 2013.
Winter Blitz – The 4th Annual Winter Blitz became open to join in 2011.


== Other ways to play ==

Despite the length of face-to-face Diplomacy games, there are people who organize and host games, and there are also various clubs that have annual tournaments and monthly club games.
To overcome the difficulty of assembling enough players for a sufficiently large block of time together, a play-by-mail game community has developed, either via Postal or Internet Diplomacy, using either humans to adjudicate the turns or automatic adjudicators. The current largest example of a dedicated online Diplomacy server with automatic adjudicators is Backstabbr.com, developed by Tile Games.


=== Postal and email play ===

Since the 1960s, Diplomacy has been played by mail through fanzines. The play-by-mail (PBM) hobby was created in 1963 by Dr. John Boardman of New York City. He did so in carbon-copied typed flyers, recruiting players through his science fiction fanzine Knowable. His flyers became an ongoing publication under the Graustark title, and led directly to the formation of other zines. Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax was also a Diplomacy PBM player in the 1960s.
By May 1965 there were eight Diplomacy zines. By the end of 1967 there were dozens of zines in the US, and by 1970 their editors were holding gatherings. In 1969, Don Turnbull started the first UK-based Diplomacy zine, Albion. These were ""affectionately"" known as ""Dippy zines"". Prior to the 1980s, most had circulations of about 50 subscribers, but some had hundreds.
By 1972, both the US and UK hobbies were forming organizations. In the 1980s, there were over sixty zines, such as Diplomacy World and the like, in the main list of the North American Zine Poll, peaking at 72 zines in 1989; and there were nearly as many in the major Zine Poll of the British part of the hobby.

Competition was fierce, leading some Diplomacy PBM players to ""go to great lengths to win"". In the UK, this included, in a few cases, bribery, blackmail, and even forging mail from other players or the Gamemaster, as well as mail interference (for example altering a letter to ensure a missed deadline was marked in time by a forged postmark). According to reviewer Martin Croft, in the early 1980s, Two players managed to get into trouble with the police ... [while] involved in complex negotiations about an attack on the gamer playing Britain. To avoid postal delays, one sent the other a telegram which read ATTACK ON LIVERPOOL CONFIRMED. Both spent some time explaining to the police that it was only a game.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the number of postal Diplomacy zines has reduced as new players instead joined the part of the hobby that plays over the internet via e-mail or on websites. In April 2010, Graustark itself ceased publication.  As of 2011, there are only a few active postal zines published in the US, one each in Canada and Australia, and several in the UK and elsewhere. In order to reduce postage and printing costs, as well as for environmental reasons, several zines (e.g. Western Front, Maniacs Paradise) are distributed to subscribers via emailed links to the zine's web page when a new issue appears, or are emailed out as PDF files, for subscribers to read on screen or print out as they choose. Some zines maintain a dual existence as paper and digital publications.
The first known electronic Diplomacy zine was Mad As Hell, distributed on Usenet in 1982. Diplomacy has been played through e-mail on the Internet since the 1983 debut of The Armchair Diplomat on Compuserve.  The GEnie online service offered fully automated versions of Diplomacy and variants to subscribers.


=== Diplomacy computer games ===

Avalon Hill released a computer game version of Diplomacy in 1984 for the IBM PC. Computer Gaming World in 1987 stated that its computer opponents ""simply stay the appetite of zealous Diplomacy players until they can gather flesh and blood victims"". The magazine in 1994 described it as ""a flop"".
Hasbro Interactive released a computer game version of Diplomacy (called Avalon Hill's Diplomacy) in 1999 under the MicroProse label, and developed by Meyer/Glass Interactive. A major fault, like with the Avalon Hill version, was that the computer AI was considered poor, one reviewer remarking ""Gamers of any skill level will have no trouble whatsoever whaling on the computer at even the highest difficulty setting.""
Paradox Interactive released a new computer version in 2005, which was given negative reviews, partly due to the odd grunts the game used to express the reactions of the AI players during the Movement phase. None of the computer games supported either text or voice chat, which limited the possibilities for complicated alliances.  In 2011, artificial intelligence scholars noted that work on Diplomacy-focused AI has been carried out since mid-1980s, but so far this endeavour met ""little success"".
The first artificial-intelligence Diplomacy conquest was organized in 2015 as part of the International Computer Game Association.
The first place in the contest was won by Dave de Jonge. 
In November 2022, Meta Platforms announced that they had developed an AI to play Diplomacy online at a competitive level, ranking in the top 10% of players.


== Reception ==
In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nick Palmer thought that despite ""primitive"" movement and combat rules, ""the game has an extraordinary charm all its own, based on the fascinating interplay of alliances between the seven players"". He concluded, ""This can be strongly recommended to anyone interested in games of multi-player negotiation"".
In the 1980 book The Complete Book of Wargames, game designer Jon Freeman called this game ""Probably the most famous wargame in existence ... The double-dealing required attracts some people irresistibly and repels others just as strongly, but the interaction in Diplomacy is the model for all other 'power politics' games."" Freeman only had two issues with the game: ""the number of players required and the time it takes to play."" Freeman gave the game an overall evaluation of ""Excellent"", concluding, ""This is a classic game in every sense of the word.""
Diplomacy was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Game designer Larry Harris explained: ""I am convinced that Allan Calhamer's masterpiece should be part of every high school curriculum. Don't tell the kids, but it teaches history, geography, the art of political negotiation, and something else – some healthy critical skepticism. By the time you get into high school, you have a pretty good idea that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!""
In its catalog, Avalon Hill advertised Diplomacy as the favorite game of John F. Kennedy. Gyles Brandreth, in the UK magazine Games & Puzzles   claimed Diplomacy was Henry Kissinger's favorite game. American broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite is reported to have been a fan of the game. Michael Portillo, British journalist, broadcaster, and former Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, is known to have played the game while studying at Harrow County School for Boys.
Diplomacy was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Adventure Hall of Fame in 1994.

The 7th Continent,Journey through a vibrant but deadly land to uncover the key to lifting your curse.,2017,1,4,"1, 2",5,1000,14,2.89,Thematic,,"The 7th Continent is a 2017 storytelling cooperative board game designed by Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter.
The game was crowdfunded through the Kickstarter platform, where it became one of the most funded projects of that year, raising over 5 million USD in less than 24 hours.


== Gameplay ==
The 7th Continent is inspired by adventure books within which players are able to make their own survival decisions. This aligns with the tagline of the game, ""YOU are the hero"". It can be played individually or with up to four individual players or teams. Players can progress through the game at their preferred pace; it features a save system that allows for the game to be paused and re-started where left off. Each player can save the items they have collected, along with their action deck and terrain card. The game requires players to use a combination of survival skills through the game. These survival skills include hunting, fishing, crafting items, using the current environment of player to advantage, and gaining experience points to trade for new skills. Players go through a different adventure each time the game is played due to the multiple possible random events and alternatives that are possible for any single card. Players can be both easily added and dropped out of a game. The game is designed to be played with cards and dice.
The game exists in a universe where a mysterious land has been discovered off the coast of Antarctica known as the seventh continent. Within this story, each player is an explorer who has just returned from the first expedition to the seventh continent. Several other members of this expedition group have disappeared suddenly upon their return. This explorer has been feeling strange symptoms for the past few days. As the explorer falls asleep at night, they are transported back to the seventh continent where they must lift the curse they are under to resolve the situation. This point is where the board game begins for each player. The goal of the game is help lift the curses that players are fighting through the help of clues. One clue per curse is provided at the start of the game. These clue cards are shuffled into the deck. The game is furthered gradually through the use of Terrain and Event cards. Terrain or adventure cards represent a patch of land or the contents of the seventh continent that a player will explore. They also include information about the events that occur around that terrain. Action cards are played to move about and take various decisions. The action deck contains skills and items that players gain through the game, as well as cards that allow exploration of the continent. These cards also represent a player's health. Players can choose to perform actions individually or in conjunction with other players.


== Versions ==
The game is exclusively available through the Serious Poulp website. There is the option of buying a ""Classic Edition"" base box and a ""Collector Edition"" base box. The ""Collector Edition"" base box is exclusively available for those who helped fund the game on Kickstarter. The ""Classic Edition"" base box retails for $69 USD through the website. Expansion card packets are also available. Additionally, various game accessories are also available for purchase through Serious Poulp. There are also mobile apps available for the game on both the Android and the Apple platforms.

Mechs vs. Minions,Cooperatively program and pilot your mechs to defeat an army of marauding minions.,2016,2,4,4,60,120,14,2.42,Strategy,  Thematic,"Cooperative board games are board games in which players work together to achieve a common goal rather than competing against each other. Either the players win the game by reaching a predetermined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event ends the game.


== Definition ==
In cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with noncompetitive games, such as The Ungame, which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete.  While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like Gloomhaven may be included, pure tabletop role-playing games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as Axis & Allies, and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like Diplomacy may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game. These games are not considered cooperative though, because players are eliminated and ultimately only one individual can win.


== History and development ==


=== 20th century ===
Early cooperative games were used by parents and teachers in educational settings. In 1903 Elizabeth Magie patented ""The Landlord's Game"", inspired by the principles and philosophy of Henry George. The Landlords' and designed as a protest against the monopolists of the time, the game is considered to be the game from which Monopoly was largely derived. In it, Magie had two rule-sets - the Monopoly rules, in which players all vied to accrue the largest revenue and crush their opponents, and a co-operative set. Her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the co-operative rules were morally superior.
In 1954, a board game version of Beat the Clock, a game show, was released. In 1956, the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City released a board game version of I've Got a Secret, a panel show, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box.
Teacher Jim Deacove published the cooperative game Together in 1971. He founded Family Pastimes in 1972 in Perth, Ontario, focusing exclusively on cooperative games. Family Pastimes has published numerous cooperative games, having released over 100 board games including the popular game of Max the Cat. The company also holds the trademark for the phrase, ""A co-operative game"".
Ken Kolsbun and Jann Kolsbun founded Animal Town in 1976 in California. They invented cooperative games such as Save the Whales, Nectar Collector, and Dam Builders. Animal Town was renamed as Child and Nature in 2003.
During the 1980s, several cooperative games like The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora, Time Tripper, and Arkham Horror were published. In the Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective series of games published in the 1980s, players are presented with a mystery to solve, and they trace the evidence together. Many cooperative Adventure board game series with Role-playing elements like Citadel of Blood, HeroQuest, Wizards (board game), Advanced HeroQuest, Deathmaze were released in this decade.
Minion Hunter is a board game originally released in 1992 by Game Designers' Workshop in conjunction with their Dark Conspiracy Role Playing Game.  The game is designed to encourage the players to work together to stall and/or defeat the plans of four monster races as a primary goal, with the individual advancement of the players as a secondary objective. Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game is set in the Star Trek universe and released in 1993. It utilizes a video tape that runs constantly while users play the board game portion. Events on the video tape combine with board game play to determine whether users win or lose the game. The video itself was directed by Les Landau and contains original footage filmed on the actual Star Trek: The Next Generation sets at Paramount Studios. Warhammer Quest is a fantasy dungeon, role-playing adventure board game released by Games Workshop in 1995 as the successor to HeroQuest and Advanced HeroQuest, set in its fictional Warhammer Fantasy world.


=== 21st century ===

In 2000, Reiner Knizia published Lord of the Rings which influenced a number of subsequent titles, including Shadows over Camelot. Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock was first published by Z-Man Games in the United States in 2008. Space Alert is a cooperative survival designer board game created by Vlaada Chvátil in 2008.  Players assume the roles of space explorers on a mission to survey the galaxy. The crew is evaluated on teamwork and how they deal with problems that arise on their journey.
Other cooperative games of the last 10 years include Star Trek: Expeditions, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Freedom: The Underground Railroad, Mechs vs. Minions, Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island, The 7th Continent, Zombicide, Spirit Island, and Hanabi, which won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2013.
Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017. It is a campaign-based dungeon crawl game with a branching narrative campaign, 95 unique playable scenarios, 17 playable classes, and more than 1,500 cards in a box which weighs almost 10 kilograms (22 lb). Gloomhaven was selected by both a jury and fans as the Origins Game Fair Best Board Game of 2018. As of early August 2018, it had sold about 120,000 copies.


== Characteristics ==
In José P. Zagal, Jochen Rick, and Idris Hsi's ""Collaborative games: Lessons learned from board games"", the lessons the researchers learned highlight what makes a good cooperative board game.
First, the game needs to point out the folly of being competitive by allowing players to make decisions that benefits themselves rather than the whole group.
Second, each player should not need the input of the rest of the group when making a decision.
Third, players need to be able to identify what actions had benefits or consequences.
Fourth, the game should reward selfless players by giving players unique roles or traits.
These researchers also point out Challenges in designing collaborative games due to the following pitfalls that must be overcome:

Game degenerating into a single player decides the actions for everyone
For a game to be engaging, players should be invested in the end result and winning the game should be satisfying
For repeat play, game experience should vary and challenge needs to evolve


=== Game as the opponent ===
Participants typically play against the game. Cooperative board games generally involve players joining forces against the game itself, and can be played without any player in the role of the opposition or Gamemaster. In Pandemic, for example, players work together to stop and cure different strains of diseases.
Also, in some cooperative games, players actually cooperate with the opposing forces in the game. For example, in Max the Cat, players are mice who keep an aggressive cat at bay by offering him milk and other appeasements. In this way, all participants in the conflict scenario are fulfilled and the resolution is truly cooperative or ""win-win"".


=== Randomness ===
In many contemporary cooperative games, randomizing devices help in varying game experience over multiple plays. Dice can be rolled, cards can be drawn each turn from a shuffled deck or various board sections of a modular board revealed to generate random objectives, events and challenges. These provide the conflict or challenge in the game, and make it progressively more difficult for the players.  For example, in Save the Whales, players work together to protect whales from the challenges inherent in the game setting—radioactive waste, commercial whaling, etc.


=== Cooperation and its variations ===
Most cooperative games bestow different abilities or responsibilities upon the players incentivizing cooperation. Some cooperative games might have an added layer of intrigue by giving players personal win conditions. In Dead of Winter: A Cross Roads Game, a zombie apocalypse game, in order to win players must achieve the communal victory condition and a personal objective. Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017 where each player also has a personal objective.


==== Opposing teams ====
In some games, there are opposing teams whose members cooperate with one another, working together against the other teams. Such teams may have equal or unequal number of players, in some cases taking the format of ""one versus all"". For example, in Scotland Yard and The Fury of Dracula, one player controls the ""enemy"", while the other players are cooperating to locate and defeat said enemy.


==== Traitor ====
A traitor game or semi-cooperative game can be seen as a cooperative game with a betrayal mechanism. While, as in a standard cooperative game, the majority of players work towards a common goal, one or more players are secretly assigned to be traitors who win if the other player fail. Determining the identity of traitors is often central to such games. For example, in Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players secretly designated as Cylons can usually be more effective if the human players are unaware who they are, and can profit from the human players suspecting each other. Other games, like Betrayal at House on the Hill, start out fully cooperative, but assigns a player to be the villain mid-game.

Star Wars: Imperial Assault,Play as Rebel or Imperial forces to fulfil mission objectives.,2014,1,5,"2, 5",60,120,14,3.3,Thematic,,"Star Wars: Assault on Hoth is a two-player strategic board game produced by West End Games and designed by Paul Murphy that recreates the Battle of Hoth as depicted in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.


== Gameplay ==
Each player takes the side of the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire on a hex map that depicts the snowy terrain of Hoth as Imperial forces attempt to destroy the Echo Base shield generator before five Rebel transports escape. Cardboard counters represent the various Rebel and Imperial soldiers and vehicles that participated in the Battle of Hoth, including Rebel light and heavy infantry, Imperial snowtrooper light and heavy infantry, AT-ST and AT-AT walkers, laser towers, and snowspeeder aircraft.
Movement is determined using a deck of 20 Action Cards that denotes which unit moves next and what actions is it allowed to perform. If an Action Card says to “Draw Event,” then a card is chosen from that deck that lists reinforcements, special unit bonuses, or a “Transport Away!” card.
In addition to hexes that determine unit placement and movement, Star Wars: Assault on Hoth incorporates “macro hexes” that are used to determine range between units engaged in combat. The game is played using two standard six-sided dice, as well as eight special six-sided dice that each have two blank sides, two Darth Vader sides, and two lightsaber sides. To determine hits, the Imperial player only counts Darth Vader results and the Rebel player only counts lightsaber results. In addition, there are three terrain types (clear, rough, and cliffs) that provide strategic advantages and impact unit movement.
In addition to units on the map, the Rebel player also secretly assigns Luke Skywalker to one of the snowspeeders and does not reveal his identity until the player is ready to use Luke's “Force Points” that allow him to boost his vehicle's armor or firepower, as well as reduce the impact of critical hits against his speeder.
The Imperial player wins if he destroys the shield generator before the fifth “Transport Away!” Event Card is drawn. The Imperial player may increase his likelihood of destroying the generator if he also destroys the Power Grid. The Rebel player wins once the fifth “Transport Away!” card is drawn or if he destroys all Imperial units on the map.


== Publication history ==
Released in 1988, Star Wars: Assault on Hoth was one of the first products published by West End Games when it first acquired the Star Wars license. (Other products included Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and its supplement books, the Star Wars Miniatures Game, and additional board games such Star Wars: Star Warriors, Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star, and Star Wars: Battle for Endor.)


== Reception ==
In Issue 37 of Challenge, Julia Martin called it ""an easy board game for two players which excitingly recreates the battle for Hoth."" Martin liked the clarity of the rules, saying that once they had been read once, ""they really need not be referred to again because of the clear design of the game."" The only thing she wished for was a mounted board rather than the paper map provided. Despite this, she concluded, ""The price is excellent for the value in fun that Assault on Hoth provides. I truly enjoyed this game.""
Games called Assault on Hoth ""exciting stuff, material for a wonderful game — if the game can recapture the speed and tension of the film. Happily, Assault on Hoth, designed by Paul Murphy, is a break-through game — fast, exciting, and with a novel system that preserves the feel of the battle while dispelling overcomplexity and fussy rules."" The review concluded that the game ""is a wonderfully quick-playing simulation game.""
In the November 1989 edition of Dragon, Jim Bambra called Assault on Hoth ""an exciting board game that uses an innovative move and action sequence to recreate the battle featured in the opening scenes of The Empire Strikes Back. The game moves at a fast pace and is easy to learn and play.""

Le Havre,"Establish a supply chain by collecting resources, building industries, and shipping.",2008,1,5,3,30,150,12,3.74,Strategy,,"Le Havre is a board game about the development of the town of Le Havre.  It was inspired by the games Caylus and Agricola and was developed in December 2007.
The game was edited by Uwe Rosenberg and Hanno Girke and the former gets the main cover credit. The illustrator was Klemens Franz while the English translator was Melissa Rogerson. Numerous credits are given to others who assisted with playtesting and other tasks.  The game was published by Lookout Games and distributed by Heidelberger Spieleverlag.
The game was released at Spiel 2008 in both German and Australian English, with both editions published by Lookout Games. It did not do as well as its predecessor Agricola in the Fairplay polls, with a rating of 2.51 (1 is best), but has a high rating of 7.9/10 at BoardGameGeek (a different rating system), ranking among the top 100 games and is generally considered to be highly regarded by critics.
The game was adapted into an iOS app by Codito Development Inc. and released on June 21, 2012. The game has a Metacritic rating of 82% based on 6 critic reviews.
A two player version called Le Havre: The Inland Port was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.


== Gameplay ==
The gameplay takes place in the harbour of Le Havre, where players take goods such as fish and wood from the wharves. These goods are used either to feed the players' community, to construct buildings and ships, or are processed into finished goods. For example, a smokehouse building may be constructed in which players may process fish into smoked fish, which is more valuable.
The game is played for a set number of rounds. The winner is the player with the greatest net wealth at the end.
Points are earned by making money, building buildings and ships (which each have their own values), and selling goods. At the end of each round, players must be able to give food to their workers. The amount of food depends on the round number and the number of players, starting out low and gradually increasing as the game progresses. Players not planning ahead will soon find themselves with a shortage of food which will require taking loans from the Bank. Building ships can help with this food problem, as each ship will give the player a discount on their food each round (they count as trade routes which give the player more sources of food).

On Mars,"Be a part of the first Martian colony, striving to be the best contributor.",2020,1,4,3,90,150,14,4.65,Strategy,,"Sky Galleons of Mars is a board wargame designed by Frank Chadwick, Marc W. Miller and Loren Wiseman, published in 1988 by Game Designers' Workshop. It is set in an alternate Victorian Era where the major nations of Earth are extending their colonial interests on Mars (a barbarian, Edgar Rice Burroughs-style planet) and Venus (a primitive planet teeming with dinosaurs). The discovery of Liftwood, a Martian plant endowed with anti-gravity powers, allows the deployment of aerial fleets in the skies of the Red Planet.
The game won Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1988 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame of 1988, and was the inspiration for the role-playing game Space: 1889. It can be played on its own or used as the tactical ship combat system for Space: 1889.


== Gameplay ==
The game is played on a hexagonal mapboard that serves to regulate movement and combat. Each hex on the map represents 200 yards, each turn represents one-minute of time.  A single plastic model represents an individual cloudship or aerial gunboat, though paper counters can also be used.
The rulebook is split into two main sections, Basic Rules and Advanced Rules. Basic is the game at its simplest form, with rules for moving, firing and taking damage. The Advanced section adds detailed rules for ramming and grappling, towing other vessels, crew small arms, crew quality, and more. The rest of the booklet includes seven scenarios along with rules for a campaign game.
During a battle, play proceeds through turns, each of which is broken down into three phases:
Initiative Phase: The players change crew assignments. If desired, boarding parties can be assembled or disbanded at this stage. Players also roll dice to determine who is the First Player that turn.
First Movement/Fire Phase: The First player moves all of his ships. Both players attack (taking into account range, weapon type, etc.). If damage is taken, it is resolved now.
Second Movement/Fire Phase: The second player moves all of his ships. Both players attack (taking into account range, weapon type, etc.). If damage is taken, it is resolved now.

Mike Siggins reviewed Sky Galleons of Mars for Games International magazine, and gave it 4 stars out of 5, and stated that ""Overall, I enjoyed Sky Galleons and found the system fresh, quick and fun to play. As we are promised true sailing ships, ether flyers and even a set of land action rules in the future, I am looking forward to the next release with interest.""
The game won Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1988 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame of 1988.

=== Cloudships & Gunboats ===

Cloudships & Gunboats is a 1989 role-playing game supplement published by GDW for Space: 1889. Cloudships & Gunboats is a boxed supplement that deals with flying ships, containing a rule booklet that contains additional, optional rules for aerial combat, expanded ship design rules, and information on several ships from the Earth and Mars; also included are deck plans for the ships, a book of record forms for the ships, and 60 cardboard characters. Cloudships & Gunboats was reviewed in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 88. The reviewer commented that ""Cloudships & Gunboats is a nicely done supplement but it is not a necessity in the game. The deck plans and ship designs are the only real reason to buy this module. Cloudships & Gunboats contains a lot of flash, but very little substance.""

Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization,"Lead your civilization through strategic drafting of leaders, technologies, and more.",2006,2,4,3,120,120,12,4.17,Strategy,,"Age of Empires is a series of historical real-time strategy video games, originally developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios. The first game was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Nine total games within the series have been released so far as of October 28, 2021.
Age of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. Another installment, Age of Empires Online, takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on mythological elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. The fourth main installment in the series, Age of Empires IV, was released on October 28, 2021.
The Age of Empires series has been a commercial success, selling over 25 million copies. Critics have credited part of the success of the series to its historical theme and fair play; the artificial intelligence (AI) players have fewer advantages than in many of the series' competitors.


== Games ==

The games in the series focus on historical events throughout time. Age of Empires covers the events between the Stone Age and the Classical period, in Europe and Asia. Its expansion, The Rise of Rome, follows the formation and rise of the Roman Empire. The Age of Kings and its Nintendo DS spin-off follow Europe and Asia through the Middle Ages. The Age of Kings' expansion pack, The Conquerors, is set during the same period, but also includes scenarios about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, El Cid, and Attila the Hun. Age of Empires III and its first expansion, The WarChiefs, take place during the European colonization of the Americas. Its second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, follows the rise of Asia in the same period. Age of Empires Online focuses on the Greek and Egyptian civilizations. The series' spin-off, Age of Mythology, and its expansion pack, The Titans, are set during the Bronze Age, but focus on mythology as their themes, rather than history.


=== Main series ===


==== Age of Empires ====

Age of Empires, released on October 15, 1997, was the first game in the series, as well as the first major release from Ensemble Studios. It was one of the first history-based real-time strategy games made, utilizing the Genie game engine. GameSpot described it as a mix of Civilization and Warcraft. The game gives players a choice of 12 civilizations to develop from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. The expansion pack, The Rise of Rome, published by Microsoft on October 31, 1998, introduced new features and four new civilizations, including the Romans. Although the two games had contained many software bugs, patches resolved many of the problems.
Age of Empires was generally well received, despite some highly negative reviews. GameSpot criticized a confused design, while Computer and Video Games praised the game as strong in single and multiplayer. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Age of Empires the 1998 ""Computer Strategy Game of the Year"". For several years, the game remained high on the sales charts, with over three million units sold by 2000. The Rise of Rome sold one million units in 2000 and attained 80% as an aggregate score from GameRankings.
In June 2017, Adam Isgreen, creative director of Xbox Game Studios announced Age of Empires: Definitive Edition at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017. It will feature overhauled graphics with support for 4K resolution, a remastered soundtrack, and other gameplay improvements, and was planned to be released on October 19, 2017, but was delayed until February 20, 2018, when it was released on the Microsoft Store. On May 30, 2019, Microsoft announced that the Definitive Edition would be coming to Steam in the future, along with the Definitive Editions of both Age of Empires II and Age of Empires III.


==== Age of Empires II ====

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, released on September 30, 1999, used the Genie game engine, and had gameplay similar to its predecessor. Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages, from the Dark Ages to the Imperial Age. It allows players to choose one of 13 civilizations, from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
On August 24, 2000, Microsoft published the expansion, The Conquerors. It added new units and five new civilizations, including two Mesoamerican civilizations: the Maya and the Aztec. The Age of Kings was a bigger critical success than the first two games, with Game Rankings and Metacritic scores of 92%. Microsoft shipped out more than two million copies to retailers, and the game received numerous awards and accolades. Critics agreed that The Conquerors expanded well on The Age of Kings, though issues of unbalanced gameplay were raised. The Age of Kings and The Conquerors won the 2000 and 2001 ""Computer Strategy Game of the Year"" awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, respectively.
In April 2013, Age of Empires II: HD Edition was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems. The HD Edition includes both the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. Originally a fan-made modpack made for The Conquerors, Age of Empires II: The Forgotten was an unofficial expansion that added a new campaign, playable civilizations, maps, and quality of service updates. The Forgotten was later developed into an official expansion with SkyBox Labs and Forgotten Empires, and in November 2013 The Forgotten HD was released by Microsoft exclusively for the HD Edition on Steam. A third expansion named The African Kingdoms was released by Microsoft in November 2015, also exclusively for the HD Edition. A fourth expansion entitled Rise of the Rajas was released on December 19, 2016. On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition.
In June 2019, Adam Isgreen, now the Franchise Creative Director for Age of Empires, shared more information regarding the Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2019. He confirmed that the Definitive Edition was being developed by Forgotten Empires, Tantalus Media, and Wicked Witch Software. He announced that the game would feature
new 4K graphics, Xbox Live support for multiplayer, exclusive achievements, four new civilizations (Bulgarians, Cumans, Lithuanians, Tatars), three new campaigns, a new spectator mode and tournament features, and additional quality of life improvements. It was released on November 14, 2019. Bert Beeckman, co-founder of Forgotten Empires, confirmed on June 12 that Age of Empires II: HD Edition would not be removed from sale after the release of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition.


==== Age of Empires III ====

Age of Empires III, released on October 18, 2005, was built on an improved version of the Age of Mythology game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and the inclusion of the Havok physics middleware engine. The game is set in the period between 1421 and 1850, and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as home cities. Described by Ensemble Studios as ""an important support system to your efforts in the New World"", home cities help provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They can be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; the feature was compared to a role-playing game character by Ensemble Studios. The first expansion to Age of Empires III, The WarChiefs, was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on Native Americans. Most notable was the introduction of the WarChief unit. The second expansion, The Asian Dynasties, went on sale October 23, 2007. It was a jointly developed product; Big Huge Games helped Ensemble Studios develop the game, with Brian Reynolds joining Bruce Shelley as lead designer. The game expanded the Age of Empires III universe into Asia, and introduced three new civilizations. Reception towards Age of Empires III was mixed; Game Revolution described it as ""about as much fun"" as a history textbook, while GameZone argued it was ""one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that is out on the market currently"". It sold more than two million copies, and won the GameSpy ""real-time strategy game of the year"" award. The WarChiefs failed to equal the success of its predecessor, with a lower score on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, and The Asian Dynasties' score was lower still with 80%.
Several collectors' editions of Age of Empires III included a hardcover artbook. The last page of the artbook has a pictorial depiction of the series; the Roman numerals below each panel range from I to V, indicating the series would include an Age of Empires IV and Age of Empires V. Ensemble Studios employee Sandy Petersen said that the image ""was total speculation on [their] part"".
In 2008, Microsoft announced they were closing down Ensemble Studios following the completion of Halo Wars. Some of its employees would form a new team as part of Microsoft Studios. Kevin Unangst, director of Games for Windows, denied it was the end of the Age of Empires series, telling The San Francisco Chronicle ""we're very excited about the future potential for Age of Empires"". Edge confirmed, in an interview with Microsoft's corporate vice president of interactive entertainment, Shane Kim, that Microsoft continued to own Age of Empires and that they had plans to continue the series. However, Bruce Shelley wrote in his blog that he would not be part of any new studios formed.
Following the announcement of remastered editions of previous games, Microsoft announced Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition on August 21, 2017. On May 30, 2019, the company revealed that the Definitive Edition would come to Steam in the future, along with the Definitive Editions of both Age of Empires and Age of Empires II. On August 28, 2020, Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2020 that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition would release officially on October 15, 2020.
On January 23, 2020, Microsoft announced a closed beta for early February of that year. Betas ran on Steam and the Microsoft Store, with each beta session including a small piece of the game. The first closed beta session began on February 11, 2020, and ended on February 19, 2020. The second closed multiplayer session began on March 31 and ran until April 7. The game was released on October 15, 2020.


==== Age of Empires IV ====

On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires IV, developed by Relic Entertainment. Microsoft's Executive Vice-President of Gaming, Phil Spencer, confirmed on June 11, 2019, that Age of Empires IV was still in development, with more information coming later in 2019. On November 14, 2019, gameplay footage of Age of Empires IV was shown at the X019 event. It showed medieval warfare between English and Mongol forces. Age of Empires IV was officially released on October 28, 2021, with eight civilizations available at launch: the Abbasid Dynasty, the Chinese, the Delhi Sultanate, the English, the French, the Holy Roman Empire, the Mongols, and the Rus. This title revisits the Middle Ages and incorporates several features and mechanics of Age of Empires II that were changed or removed in Age of Empires III.


=== Spin-off games ===

Age of Mythology shared many elements of gameplay with the main series, and was considered a part of the series, despite its different focus. The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with Poseidon. Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002, and its expansion, The Titans, on October 21, 2003. The Titans featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization. Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the titans and frees them from Tartarus. Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.
Backbone Entertainment developed Age of Empires: The Age of Kings as a turn-based game for the Nintendo DS. Majesco Entertainment published the game on February 14, 2006. It is similar to other turn-based games, such as Advance Wars, but with a gameplay based on its PC counterpart. Age of Empires: The Age of Kings scored 80% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. Konami brought a game of the same title to the PlayStation 2 around five years earlier than the DS version, but the game had little promotion, and sold poorly.
On August 16, 2010, Microsoft announced Age of Empires Online, which was a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, it developed in collaboration with Robot Entertainment. It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, as well as more quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.
On April 13, 2014, Age of Empires: World Domination was announced. It was developed by KLab Games for the iOS, Android and Windows Phone. It was released on December 7, 2015, with the service terminated on November 30, 2016.
On August 25, 2014, Age of Empires: Castle Siege was announced. It is a touch-based game developed by Smoking Gun Interactive. It was released on September 17, 2014, for the Windows PC and Windows Phone 8.


== Development ==


=== Historical elements ===
The development phases of the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is ""a good idea for most entertainment products"". Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, ""not [its] designers or researchers"". At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained that the success of the series laid in ""making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer"". Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather ""about the human experience;"" they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as ""going into space"". Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they ""couldn't get away"" with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.


=== Artificial intelligence ===
The artificial intelligence (AI) used in the Age of Empires series has been developed and improved regularly by designers. AI specialist Dave Pottinger noted the development team gave the AI in the original game a very high priority, and spent over a year working on it. He said that the AI in the game relies on tactics and strategies to win, instead of ""cheating"" by giving bonus resources to itself, or tweaking its units to be stronger than normal. Pottinger later noted that the Age of Empires series team took great pride in their AI playing a ""fair game"" and didn't know what the player was doing and had to play by the same rules as its human opponents.
Age of Empires allows players to choose to play either along specialized, story-backed conditions or as individual battles against the AI (and other players). Choosing to battle against the AI – rather than following the storyline – allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies and even remember which games it won and lost. The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games. For instance, in Age of Empires III, this is referred to as playing a ""Skirmish"". However, Age of Empires III allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by ""building a Deck"", which allows players to replace ""Home City"" shipments with improved alternatives.
In Age of Empires II: The Conquerors the AI was given a high priority, the result being the ""smart villager"" feature, which was included in subsequent games of the series. After building a structure that stores or produces resources, smart villagers would proceed to collect resources related to the structure, such as crops from farms or ore from exposed deposits.
Age of Mythology: The Titans lets players use an AI debugger when creating custom scenarios; players can change the settings of computer players and make them act according to certain patterns. More basic changes to the AI had previously been available in the series' first two games.


=== Graphics and visuals ===
The graphics and visuals of Age of Empires improved with each successive release. From the original release to the second, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, noteworthy improvements gained praise from several critics. With the release of Age of Mythology the praise continued, and the fourth release, Age of Empires III, garnered even more.
GameSpot praised the improved graphics in the second release, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Eurogamer welcomed its introduction of female villagers as compared with the original male only version. Allgame praised the advanced grouping and path-finding systems in the second release. Despite the improved graphics, Allgame complained that units in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings were at times difficult to distinguish from one another, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. Nevertheless, Game Revolution wrote that the second release was ""the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now"".
The graphics continued to improve in Age of Mythology and was praised by a majority of reviewers. IGN ranked the graphics in this third release ""a joy to watch ... awesome"". GameSpot assented, also rating the graphics a 9 out of 10. Game Revolution agreed, and PC Gamer stated that the graphics in the third release ""are packed with detail"".
The trend in improved graphics continued well into the next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, ""After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail."" 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as ""one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future"". GameSpy agreed, stating, ""Age III's graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre."" Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about ""the awkward unit behavior"". Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.
GameSpy awarded Age of Empires III the ""Best Graphics"" award at GameSpy's ""Game of the Year 2005"".


=== Music ===
Stephen Rippy has been the series' music director since the first game. He has had occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires with sounds of instruments from the periods in the game. These sounds came from actual instruments, and their digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used. Rippy said that sound development on The Age of Kings was easy, since there was knowledge of the instruments used in the Middle Ages. Therefore, they were able to reproduce the tunes for the soundtrack of the game. In Age of Mythology, an orchestral instrumentation was used, instead. According to McMullan, the team also collected large numbers of audio recordings from zoos, and created ""a massive sound library of [their] own material"". The music of Age of Empires III was similar to The Age of Kings, in which the team used more historical instruments; Rippy noted the team used instruments such as ""bagpipes and field drums"" to give it a realistic feel.


=== Collaboration ===
Ensemble Studios worked together with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires III's second expansion. This was the first joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games did most of the work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.


== Reception and legacy ==

The Age of Empires series has been a commercial success. As of 2008, five of its games have each sold more than one million copies. According to Gamasutra, Age of Empires had sold more than three million copies, and The Rise of Rome sold one million copies as of 2000. Around the same time, Microsoft announced that they shipped over two million copies of The Age of Kings. In 2003, Microsoft announced the sales of one million copies for Age of Mythology. By 2004—prior to the release of Age of Empires III—the Age of Empires franchise had sold over 15 million copies. On May 18, 2007, Ensemble Studios announced that two million copies of Age of Empires III had been sold.
Games in the series have consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the adjacent table, the highest rating game is Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, receiving a 92% score from both sites.
Critics have credited Age of Empires for influencing real-time strategy (RTS) games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, and Cossacks. Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds was also influenced by the series: it utilized the Genie game engine, as Age of Empires and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings had, and was considered by critics to be a very close replica to the games; IGN began their review with the statement ""I love Age of Star Wars, I mean Star Empires. Whatever it's called, I dig it."" and GameSpot wrote that ""fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can jump right in"". In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a GameSpy interview, he explained that parents would ""tell Ensemble Studios that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the triremes so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [the] game taught them what a trebuchet was"".
Shelley has said that the key to the success of the games was its innovation, rather than imitation of its peers. He also claimed the unique elements in the games ""helped establish the reputation of Ensemble Studios as masters of the real-time strategy genre"". Mark Bozon of IGN wrote in his review of The Age of Kings, ""The Age of Empires series has been one of the most innovative real-time strategy games for PC in the last decade or so."" Gamenikki called Ensemble Studios ""the developer that started it all"" when they talked about how much Age of Empires III had done to advance the real-time strategy genre. Shelley has acknowledged the success and innovation of Age of Empires helped to ensure Ensemble survive its early periods since startup. In 2005, Shelley complained of critics holding an ""innovation bias"" against the series; citing the 60% score from Computer Gaming World, he said that despite Age of Empires III being ""perhaps the best selling PC game in the world"" at the time, reviewers expected ""something really new"" and rated it harshly.
Bungie chose Ensemble Studios to develop Halo Wars, an RTS game based on their Halo series. They said that one of the reasons they chose to work with Ensemble was because of the Age of Empires series. They also noted that Ensemble was the perfect choice ""to realize the original vision of Halo"", which started life as an RTS.

Aeon's End,"Mages defend humanity’s last city, harnessing alien powers to destroy monstrosities.",2016,1,4,2,60,60,14,2.78,Strategy,,"A legacy game is a variant of tabletop board games in which the game itself is designed, through various mechanics, to change permanently over the course of a series of sessions.


== History ==
Game designer Rob Daviau claims to have come up with the idea at a work meeting after jokingly asking why the murderous characters in Clue are always invited back to dinner. Realizing that each new game resets, Daviau thought about what it would be like if everyone would remember who the murderer was, and he pitched the idea of a Clue legacy game to Hasbro.

While that idea was rejected, Daviau was later asked to use the mechanic in a new version of Risk. Risk Legacy was released in 2011 and was his first game to use this format.
Daviau followed up with an award-winning Pandemic variant, Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, which was released in 2015 to positive reviews and praised as a leap forward in modern board game design. Daviau continues to develop legacy games and co-developed a mechanic, the Echo System, to retain permanent changes through subsequent games in a franchise.
Daviau cited his work on Betrayal at House on the Hill (which was later adapted into a legacy version) and Trivial Pursuit: DVD – Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition as predecessors to the legacy idea. The latter was designed in such a way that pre-programmed games sorted the cards by difficulty. This caused some vocal backlash as the game was perceived by many to have a more definite end than other versions.


== Common mechanics and themes ==
Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. As such they have been compared to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. New rules can be introduced as the campaign goes on, allowing for the game to expand both mechanically and thematically. Games can use the expanding campaign as a mode of storytelling; Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 uses a three-act structure to tell its story. Daviau describes legacy games as ""experiential"" in contrast to traditional games, which are ""repeatable"". He compared his legacy games to that of a concert where you ""buy a ticket for an experience"" while Haoran Un of Kotaku describes the idea as ""avant-garde performance art"".
Legacy games break certain covenants that players expect from traditional board games. Permanent, physical changes can occur to components based on game outcomes and player choices. For instance players might be instructed to write names on cards, place stickers on the game board, or destroy some components. This causes each copy of the game to be unique at the end and has earned the legacy genre criticism in that there is a finite amount of replayability. Some games have been designed to be replayable with refill packs or non-permanent stickers while others are still playable with the final permanent changes once the campaign is over.

Fields of Arle,"Construct dikes, drain bogs, harvest flax and tend to newborn animals in East Frisia.",2014,1,2,2,60,120,13,3.88,Strategy,,"The Deutscher Spielepreis (German: [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃpiːləˌpʁaɪs], German Game Prize) (DSP) is an important award for boardgames. It was started in 1990 by the German magazine Die Pöppel-Revue, which collects votes from the industry's  stores, magazines, professionals and game clubs. The results are announced every October at the Spiel game fair in Essen, Germany. The Essen Feather is awarded at the same ceremony.
In contrast to the Spiel des Jahres, which tends to be awarded to family games, the DSP is awarded for ""gamers' games"" with particularly good or innovative gameplay. Although at one point it was not uncommon for the DSP and the SdJ to be awarded to the same game (as was the case for The Settlers of Catan, El Grande, and Tikal in the 1990s), since Carcassonne (2001) only two games have succeeded in winning both awards: Dominion in 2009 and Azul in 2018.

They are presented by the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design at the Origins Game Fair on an annual basis for the previous year; for example, the 1979 awards were given at the 1980 Origins. Categories for the Origins award can vary from year to year, and there is not a ""Game of the Year"" per se.
The Origins Award is commonly referred to as a Calliope, as the statuette is in the likeness of the muse of the same name. Academy members frequently shorten this name to ""Callie"".


=== Premio JdA ===
This award is for Game of the Year in Spain, ""Premio al Juego de mesa del año"" (Premio JdA), by an independent jury of game industry representatives.


=== Spiel des Jahres ===
These games are winners of the Spiel des Jahres, a German board game award widely considered the most prestigious in the industry.


==== Kennerspiel des Jahres ====
These are winners of Kennerspiel des Jahres, an expansion of the German Spiel des Jahres board game award starting in 2011. It translates to ""connoisseur/expert game of the year"" and is meant for more experienced gamers.


==== Kinderspiel des Jahres ====
The Kinderspiel des Jahres is awarded annually to the best children's game by a jury of German game critics. This award is to children's games what the Spiel des Jahres is to family games.
2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was a subcategory of the Spiel des Jahres awards known as the Sonderpreis ""Kinderspiel"" (""Special Prize for Best Children's Game""). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989–2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres.

Race for the Galaxy,"Worlds await! Colonize, develop and conquer taking advantage of others' choices.",2007,2,4,2,30,60,12,2.99,Strategy,,"Race for the Galaxy (abbreviated RftG or simply Race) is a card game designed by Thomas Lehmann. It was released in 2007 by Rio Grande Games. Its theme is to build galactic civilizations via game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments.  It accommodates two to four players by default although expansions allow for up to six players, as well as solo play. The game uses iconography in place of language in some places, with complex powers also having a text description. While appreciated by experienced players for being concise, some new players find the icons difficult to learn and to decipher.
The game won Boardgamegeek's Golden Geek Award for best card game, Fairplay Magazine's À la carte award for best card game of 2008, and was described by the magazine Tric Trac as ""Le jeu de cartes de cette année 2008"" (The card game of the year 2008).


== Development ==
Race for the Galaxy by Thomas Lehmann began as a card game version of Puerto Rico, with Thomas Lehmann working on his own and in cooperation with Andreas Seyfarth, and while Lehmann's version did not make it into publication as San Juan in 2004, he continued work on the game and added a space-themed customizable card game and this was ultimately released as Race for the Galaxy by Rio Grande Games. 


== Gameplay ==
Like many other Euro-style games, players win Race by having the most victory points at game end. VPs come from three sources: worlds and developments placed on a player's tableau, and VP chips earned by consuming goods from worlds. To place a world or development, players pay a cost in cards from their hand. Keeping a steady income of new cards throughout the game is important to victory.


=== Phase selection ===
At the start of each round, all players simultaneously and secretly choose one of five phases: Explore, Develop, Settle, Consume, or Produce. Selections are revealed simultaneously. The only phases which actually occur in a round are those selected by players. Additionally, the players who picked a certain phase get a special bonus during that phase, such as the ability to look at more cards during the Explore phase.
Every card in play has powers which are active during various phases. For instance, the development  ""Investment Credits"" has a Develop power which makes placing developments one card cheaper.


=== Round play ===
Within a round, phases (those selected by players) happen in the following order:

Explore – Draw two cards and keep one.
Develop – Play a development.
Settle – Play a world, either by paying to take it peacefully or by military conquest.
Consume – ""Ship"" resources for cards and VPs. As a bonus activity, players can Trade a resource to earn many cards, but no VPs.
Produce – Put a good (a face-down card from the deck) on all production worlds that do not have one.
After all phases are complete, players discard down to a hand limit of 10 cards.  Unusually among card games, cards discarded due to the hand limit or when paying a cost are placed face-down (in a ""messy"" pile to distinguish them from the draw deck), concealing information that could be used to deduce upcoming draws.
Play continues until, at the end of a round, either at least one player has 12 or more cards in their tableau, or the entire starting pool of victory point tokens has been claimed by the players. At that point, the player with the highest total of victory points from tokens and from cards in their tableau is the winner.


=== Race vs. other titles ===
The play style of the game is similar to that of another Rio Grande game, San Juan, which is the card game version of the board game Puerto Rico. Lehmann, Race's designer, developed his own card game version of Puerto Rico at the request of the publisher. Some of its ideas were incorporated in San Juan. Later, Lehmann used those ideas to create a different game, one of space exploration, settlement, and conquest rather than development in the colonial Caribbean.
The principal difference in the playing sequence between Race and Puerto Rico/San Juan is that in the latter games, a given phase can only be chosen by one player each round, and the order of activities is based on player order and the phases each player picks in succession; in Race, multiple players may choose the same phase, and the order of activity execution is fixed.
Wei-Hwa Huang, who is credited as a development assistant for Race, went on to become the primary designer of Roll for the Galaxy (assisted by Tom Lehmann). In this adaptation six-sided dice represent a player's workers, with rolls determining what phases workers are placed in.


== Expansions ==

During playtesting, plans were made for two expansions to add more variety to gameplay, shore up certain strategies, and to accommodate more players. The game's success prompted the publisher to request a third expansion, as well as new expansions not requiring the original trio.
Currently there are five expansions for Race. The first three expansions, Gathering Storm, Rebel vs Imperium, and The Brink of War, comprise the first expansion arc. These expansions thematically focus on a struggle for galactic control between the militarily powerful Imperium and a Rebel uprising. The second arc, which is designed to be played separately from the first, includes only the expansion Alien Artifacts, about the revival of long-dead Alien overseer technology. In the third arc the Xeno Invasion set chronicles a catastrophic invasion by monstrous ""Xenos"" from a distant world.
All the expansions provide new game cards, starting worlds, and support for at least five players. Many new mechanics also interact with base set keywords, such as ""Rebel"" or ""Uplift"".


=== The Gathering Storm ===
The first expansion adds components for a fifth player, additional cards, goals (opportunities to gain extra victory points chosen at random at game start), and rules and components for solo play (against a ""robot"" player).


=== Rebel vs Imperium ===
The second expansion is intended for use with the first expansion. It adds components for a sixth player, more cards and goals, and direct player interaction in takeovers of other players' military worlds; players who refrain from playing certain cards are immune to conquest. Takeovers are optional and the rules for this expansion encourage trying the game both with and without them. This set also introduces many new Rebel and Imperium Cards and introduces a special two-player scenario where one player takes the role of The Imperium while the other starts with a Rebel homeworld. In this variant the starting hands consist partly of Imperium/Rebel cards and takeovers are allowed.


=== The Brink of War ===
The third expansion adds still more cards, and goals, as well as a new mechanic called galactic prestige. Each round the player(s) with the most prestige earn an additional victory point and possibly a card. Each prestige is worth one victory point at the end of the game, and many of the new cards allow prestige to be spent (for victory points, cards, or other effects). Additionally, a new ""once-per-game"" action is introduced that allows the user to search the deck for a card meeting a specific stated requirement, or to enhance the bonus the user earns in a round (at the cost of one prestige). The set further extends takeover options: the Interstellar Casus Belli development can allow attacks against anyone, and the Imperium Planet Buster can destroy enemy worlds outright.


=== Alien Artifacts ===
The fourth expansion is used with only the base game and was released during 2013. It includes new explore powers and an optional ""orb game"" in which players explore for victory points and new powers. Some players have criticized the gameplay of the orb game while praising the game cards in the set, saying that the orb makes the overall game play non-simultaneously and last too long.


=== Xeno Invasion ===
The fifth expansion, published 2015, is for use with the base game only. According to Lehmann, ""XI is aimed at intermediate players"" and has the most new base cards of any expansion so far. It allows for up to 5 players, and in addition to new world and development cards it includes an optional ""Invasion Game"", in which players must defeat three waves of Xeno alien invaders. Players can earn bonuses by contributing to the war effort, but the game can also end in two new ways: repulsing the Xeno threat or losing to the invaders.


== Reception ==
Race for the Galaxy was a finalist for the best ""Traditional Card Game"" at the Origins Awards.
Arjun Sukumaran said that ""Thomas Lehmann has received abundant acclaim over the course of his game design career, most notably for his excellent Race for the Galaxy - a game many would consider to be the best card game around.""
Matthew Monagle for /Film said in 2021 that ""it is a testament to Thomas Lehmann's design that a game released in 2007, an eternity ago in board game years, can still compete with the big boys a decade-plus later.""

Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island,Work together — with friends or with Friday — to survive on a deserted island.,2012,1,4,,60,120,14,3.8,Thematic,,"Cooperative board games are board games in which players work together to achieve a common goal rather than competing against each other. Either the players win the game by reaching a predetermined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event ends the game.


== Definition ==
In cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with noncompetitive games, such as The Ungame, which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete.  While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like Gloomhaven may be included, pure tabletop role-playing games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as Axis & Allies, and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like Diplomacy may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game. These games are not considered cooperative though, because players are eliminated and ultimately only one individual can win.


== History and development ==


=== 20th century ===
Early cooperative games were used by parents and teachers in educational settings. In 1903 Elizabeth Magie patented ""The Landlord's Game"", inspired by the principles and philosophy of Henry George. The Landlords' and designed as a protest against the monopolists of the time, the game is considered to be the game from which Monopoly was largely derived. In it, Magie had two rule-sets - the Monopoly rules, in which players all vied to accrue the largest revenue and crush their opponents, and a co-operative set. Her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the co-operative rules were morally superior.
In 1954, a board game version of Beat the Clock, a game show, was released. In 1956, the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City released a board game version of I've Got a Secret, a panel show, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box.
Teacher Jim Deacove published the cooperative game Together in 1971. He founded Family Pastimes in 1972 in Perth, Ontario, focusing exclusively on cooperative games. Family Pastimes has published numerous cooperative games, having released over 100 board games including the popular game of Max the Cat. The company also holds the trademark for the phrase, ""A co-operative game"".
Ken Kolsbun and Jann Kolsbun founded Animal Town in 1976 in California. They invented cooperative games such as Save the Whales, Nectar Collector, and Dam Builders. Animal Town was renamed as Child and Nature in 2003.
During the 1980s, several cooperative games like The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora, Time Tripper, and Arkham Horror were published. In the Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective series of games published in the 1980s, players are presented with a mystery to solve, and they trace the evidence together. Many cooperative Adventure board game series with Role-playing elements like Citadel of Blood, HeroQuest, Wizards (board game), Advanced HeroQuest, Deathmaze were released in this decade.
Minion Hunter is a board game originally released in 1992 by Game Designers' Workshop in conjunction with their Dark Conspiracy Role Playing Game.  The game is designed to encourage the players to work together to stall and/or defeat the plans of four monster races as a primary goal, with the individual advancement of the players as a secondary objective. Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game is set in the Star Trek universe and released in 1993. It utilizes a video tape that runs constantly while users play the board game portion. Events on the video tape combine with board game play to determine whether users win or lose the game. The video itself was directed by Les Landau and contains original footage filmed on the actual Star Trek: The Next Generation sets at Paramount Studios. Warhammer Quest is a fantasy dungeon, role-playing adventure board game released by Games Workshop in 1995 as the successor to HeroQuest and Advanced HeroQuest, set in its fictional Warhammer Fantasy world.


=== 21st century ===

In 2000, Reiner Knizia published Lord of the Rings which influenced a number of subsequent titles, including Shadows over Camelot. Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock was first published by Z-Man Games in the United States in 2008. Space Alert is a cooperative survival designer board game created by Vlaada Chvátil in 2008.  Players assume the roles of space explorers on a mission to survey the galaxy. The crew is evaluated on teamwork and how they deal with problems that arise on their journey.
Other cooperative games of the last 10 years include Star Trek: Expeditions, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Freedom: The Underground Railroad, Mechs vs. Minions, Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island, The 7th Continent, Zombicide, Spirit Island, and Hanabi, which won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2013.
Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017. It is a campaign-based dungeon crawl game with a branching narrative campaign, 95 unique playable scenarios, 17 playable classes, and more than 1,500 cards in a box which weighs almost 10 kilograms (22 lb). Gloomhaven was selected by both a jury and fans as the Origins Game Fair Best Board Game of 2018. As of early August 2018, it had sold about 120,000 copies.


== Characteristics ==
In José P. Zagal, Jochen Rick, and Idris Hsi's ""Collaborative games: Lessons learned from board games"", the lessons the researchers learned highlight what makes a good cooperative board game.
First, the game needs to point out the folly of being competitive by allowing players to make decisions that benefits themselves rather than the whole group.
Second, each player should not need the input of the rest of the group when making a decision.
Third, players need to be able to identify what actions had benefits or consequences.
Fourth, the game should reward selfless players by giving players unique roles or traits.
These researchers also point out Challenges in designing collaborative games due to the following pitfalls that must be overcome:

Game degenerating into a single player decides the actions for everyone
For a game to be engaging, players should be invested in the end result and winning the game should be satisfying
For repeat play, game experience should vary and challenge needs to evolve


=== Game as the opponent ===
Participants typically play against the game. Cooperative board games generally involve players joining forces against the game itself, and can be played without any player in the role of the opposition or Gamemaster. In Pandemic, for example, players work together to stop and cure different strains of diseases.
Also, in some cooperative games, players actually cooperate with the opposing forces in the game. For example, in Max the Cat, players are mice who keep an aggressive cat at bay by offering him milk and other appeasements. In this way, all participants in the conflict scenario are fulfilled and the resolution is truly cooperative or ""win-win"".


=== Randomness ===
In many contemporary cooperative games, randomizing devices help in varying game experience over multiple plays. Dice can be rolled, cards can be drawn each turn from a shuffled deck or various board sections of a modular board revealed to generate random objectives, events and challenges. These provide the conflict or challenge in the game, and make it progressively more difficult for the players.  For example, in Save the Whales, players work together to protect whales from the challenges inherent in the game setting—radioactive waste, commercial whaling, etc.


=== Cooperation and its variations ===
Most cooperative games bestow different abilities or responsibilities upon the players incentivizing cooperation. Some cooperative games might have an added layer of intrigue by giving players personal win conditions. In Dead of Winter: A Cross Roads Game, a zombie apocalypse game, in order to win players must achieve the communal victory condition and a personal objective. Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017 where each player also has a personal objective.


==== Opposing teams ====
In some games, there are opposing teams whose members cooperate with one another, working together against the other teams. Such teams may have equal or unequal number of players, in some cases taking the format of ""one versus all"". For example, in Scotland Yard and The Fury of Dracula, one player controls the ""enemy"", while the other players are cooperating to locate and defeat said enemy.


==== Traitor ====
A traitor game or semi-cooperative game can be seen as a cooperative game with a betrayal mechanism. While, as in a standard cooperative game, the majority of players work towards a common goal, one or more players are secretly assigned to be traitors who win if the other player fail. Determining the identity of traitors is often central to such games. For example, in Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players secretly designated as Cylons can usually be more effective if the human players are unaware who they are, and can profit from the human players suspecting each other. Other games, like Betrayal at House on the Hill, start out fully cooperative, but assigns a player to be the villain mid-game.

7 Wonders ,Draft cards to develop your ancient civilization and build its Wonder of the World.,2010,2,7,"4, 5",30,30,10,2.33,Family,  Strategy,"7 Wonders is a board game created by Antoine Bauza in 2010 and originally published by Repos Production (part of Asmodee Group). Three decks of cards featuring images of historical civilizations, armed conflicts, and commercial activity are used in the card drafting game 7 Wonders. The game received critical success upon its release, and won numerous awards, including the inaugural Kennerspiel des Jahres connoisseurs' award in 2011.


== Gameplay ==
7 Wonders is a dedicated deck card game that features ancient civilizations. At the start of the game, each player randomly receives a gameboard called a ""Wonder board"". Each board depicts one of Antipater of Sidon's original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Players place cards representing various materials and structures around their Wonder boards. The boards are double-sided; the wonders on side A are generally easier to build, while those on side B grant more interesting benefits.
7 Wonders is played over three ages totalling 18 turns, known in the game as Ages I, II, and III, each using its own decks of cards. In each age, seven cards are randomly dealt to each player. The game uses a card-drafting mechanic in which, once per turn, each player selects a card to play from his or her hand, then passes the remaining cards (face-down) to the next player. This process is repeated until five out of the seven cards have been played. At this point, each player must choose to play one of his remaining two cards and discard the other.
Each age card represents a structure, and playing a card is referred to as building a structure. To build a structure, a player must first pay the construction cost, in coins or in one or more of the seven resource types, then lay it down by his or her Wonder board. A player lacking the resources available may pay his direct neighbors to use their resources, normally at two coins per resource, if available.
Some cards also belong to free construction chains. Cards played in previous ages can allow players to construct cards in ages 2 and 3 for free. For example, many of the science cards allow players to build several age 2 and 3 structures for free.
Instead of building a structure, a player may choose either to discard an Age card to earn three coins from the bank or to use the card to build a stage of his or her wonder. The Wonder boards have from two to four stages, shown at the bottom of the board. To build a wonder stage, a player must pay the resource cost listed on the stage, then put an age card underneath the wonder board in the appropriate place.
There are seven types of Age cards, representing different types of structures, which are determined by the color of their background:

Brown cards (raw materials) provide one or two of the four raw material resources used in the game (wood, ore, clay brick, and stone).
Grey cards (manufactured goods) provide one of the three manufactured goods used in the game (glass, papyrus, and textiles).
Red cards (military structures) contain ""shield"" symbols; these are added together to give a player's military strength, which is used in conflict resolution at the end of each age.
Blue cards (civic structures [mistranslated as ""civilian"" in the game rules]): all grant a fixed number of victory points.
Yellow cards (commercial structures) have several effects: they can grant coins, resources, and/or victory points or decrease the cost of buying resources from neighbors.
Green cards (scientific structures): each card has one of three symbols. Combinations of the symbols are worth victory points.
Purple cards (guilds) generally grant victory points based on the structures a player and/or his neighbors have built.
Brown and grey cards only appear in the Age I and II decks; purple cards only appear in the Age III deck.
At the end of each age, military conflicts are resolved between neighbors. This is done by comparing the number of shield symbols on the players' red cards, and awarding victory points accordingly. Once all three decks have been played, players tally their scores in all the different developed areas (civil, scientific, commercial, etc.). The player with the most victory points wins.
In the base game, there are seven means of obtaining victory points:

Military victories – one point for each victory (having the most shields) during the first age, 3 for the second age, and 5 for the third age. Each defeat makes a player lose 1 victory point regardless of the age.
Gold coins – one point for every 3 coins a player possesses at the end of the game.
Wonder stages – many of the wonder stages grant a fixed number of victory points.
Civic structures (blue cards) – each structure grants a fixed number of victory points.
Commercial structures (yellow cards) – Age III commercial structures grant victory points based on certain structures a player has built.
Guilds (purple cards) – the guilds provide several means of gaining victory points, most of which are based on the types of structure a player and/or his/her neighbors have built.
Scientific structures (green cards) – each green card has a symbol on it – tablet, compass, or gear. One card of a type grants one victory point, but two cards grant four; the number of points granted is equal to the number of symbols possessed squared. Additionally, each set of tablet, compass, and gear possessed is worth 7 points.


== Expansions ==


=== 7 Wonders: Leaders (2011) ===
This expansion introduces the white-backed leader cards, which can be recruited to aid a player's city. The 36 leader cards are based on real historical figures or legends: Amytis, Alexander, Archimedes, Aristotle, Bilkis, Caesar, Cleopatra, Croesus, Euclid, Hammurabi, Hannibal, Hatshepsut, Hiram, Hypatia, Imhotep, Justinian, Leonidas, Maecenas, Midas, Nebuchadnezzar, Nefertiti, Nero, Pericles, Phidias, Plato, Praxiteles, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, Ramesses, Sappho, Solomon, Tomyris, Varro, Vitruvius, Xenophon, and Zenobia. A brief biography of each leader is featured in the rulebook.
Playing with the Leaders expansion changes the game mechanic, as the second thing done in the game after choosing a Wonder board is to choose leaders. Four leader cards are dealt to each player, and the cards are drafted. At the start of each Age, players may recruit one leader, paying its coin cost and putting it into play. To compensate for this extra expense, with the Leaders expansion, players start with six coins instead of three. As with the Age cards, instead of recruiting a leader, a player may choose to discard the card to gain three coins or build a Wonder stage with it.
The leaders grant various abilities, including additional means of gaining victory points, resources, or coins, resource cost reductions, commerce benefits, additional shields, and scientific symbols. For example, the ""Caesar"" card grants two shields and ""Midas"" grants one extra victory point per three coins held at the end of the game.
The expansion comes with four additional guild cards and one extra Wonder board – the Colosseum of Rome, which grants abilities related to the new leader cards.


=== 7 Wonders: Cities (August 2012) ===
The Cities expansion introduces nine city cards (with a black background) to each of the Age card decks. The number of city cards that are shuffled into each age's deck is equal to the number of players. This means that each age now consists of seven play of cards.
The city cards can have quite an impact on gameplay, as many of them are more powerful but expensive versions of existing cards; for example, the Age III ""Contingent"" card provides five shields as opposed to the three provided by Age III red cards. The cards also introduce some new concepts such as diplomacy, which allows a player to avoid military conflict for one Age, and monetary loss, which forces the player's opponents to either pay coins to the bank or lose victory points if they cannot or will not pay.
The addition of city cards takes the total number of cards playable in each age to 56. This means that eight-player games – or team games with four teams of two – are possible. In the team game, partners are allowed to see each other's cards and discuss which ones to play, and the effect of diplomacy is modified.
The Cities expansion also contains three new guild cards, six leader cards (Aspasia, Berenice, Caligula, Darius, Diocletian, Semiramis), and two Wonder boards (the Hagia Sophia of Byzantium and Al Khazneh of Petra). Many of these new additions have abilities specific to city cards or to the new concepts introduced.


=== 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (May 2013) ===
This expansion adds four Wonder boards: Abu Simbel, the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge, and the Manneken Pis of Brussels (the hometown of the game's creators).


=== 7 Wonders: Babel (December 2014) ===
Babel consists of two expansions that can be added separately or together. The first expansion is Tower of Babel, in which players can choose to construct the tower. By discarding a card, players can place a tile on the tower that affects play (for example, taxing the construction of Wonders or granting a monetary bonus for building certain cards) until it is covered by a subsequent tile. Players score points for the number of tiles they play. The second expansion is Great Projects of Babel. A building of a certain color is put into play. Whenever a player plays a card of the same color, they may choose to pay a cost to participate in the building of the Great Project. If the project succeeds, all players who participated get a reward, and non-participants get nothing. If the project fails, participants get nothing and non-participants receive a penalty.


=== 7 Wonders: Leaders Anniversary Pack & Cities Anniversary Pack (2017) ===
These expansions add new Leaders cards and new Cities cards, with new effects. The new Leaders are all powerful women of history: Aganice, Agrippina, Arsinoe, Cornelia, Cynisca, Enheduanna, Eurypyle, Gorgo, Makeda, Nitocris, Octavia, Phryne, Roxana, Telesilla, and Theano.


=== 7 Wonders: Armada (October 2018) ===
Armada adds a naval board for each player and four ships: red, blue, yellow, and green. When playing a card of one of these colors, players may pay an additional cost to advance the corresponding ship along the board. Advancing each ship grants different bonuses: the red ship grants naval strength, which is compared to all players at the end of the Age, not just neighbors; the yellow ship grants money; the blue ship grants victory points; and the green ship allows players to discover islands, which grant extra bonuses.


=== 7 Wonders Second Edition (2020) ===
The second edition of 7 Wonders was released in 2020. The graphics, wonders in the base game, and cards cost and chains were slightly modified. Most notably in the base game, the Strategists' Guild was replaced by the Decorator's Guild, which grants 7 points if all of a player's wonder steps are built by the end of the game. Olympia and Babylon received the biggest changes in terms of abilities. Leaders, Cities, and Armada also received changes in the second edition in terms of graphics and abilities.


== Spin-offs ==


=== 7 Wonders: Duel (October 2015) ===
7 Wonders: Duel is a two player version of 7 Wonders in which players alternate drafting from an overlapping pyramid of cards. A version of the game for iOS and Android was released by Repos Digital in 2019. An Ars Technica review stated that ""[the] game's three win conditions—civilian, scientific, and military—ensure that you're always juggling several plates, and the whole thing plays like a lightning-quick, board-less match of Civilization"". The game also appeared on a New York Times list, with the reviewers praising its multiple ways of victory, the game arc, complexity, replayability, and strategy, but was criticised for its difficult learning curve. Dicebreaker also considered it to be one of the best card drafting games. IGN considered it to be superior to the original, and was complimentary to the new draft system.


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – Pantheon (October 2016) ===
The expansion to 7 Wonders: Duel added new abilities to the game via a rotating pantheon of gods, as well as two new wonders.


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – Agora (January 2021) ===
Adds a Senate with new play mechanics based on new senator and ""conspirator"" cards. The expansion includes two new tokens and two new Wonders based on this while introducing a new ""political victory"".


=== 7 Wonders: Duel – promotional wonders ===
Messe Essen (2015)
Statue of Liberty (2016)
Stonehenge (2017)
Sagrada Familia (2018)


=== 7 Wonders: Architects (2021) ===
A whole new game based on multiple decks and wonders of different bits and pieces which the players construct. The publishers stated that it was more family-friendly than its predecessor but still deep enough for ""gamers"" to enjoy. The game was recommended for the 2022 Spiel des Jahres.


== Reception ==

The game is highly regarded, and has won more than 30 gaming awards, including the inaugural Kennerspiel des Jahres connoisseurs' award in November 2011. The program with a tonne of features geared towards everyone from the beginner wishing to learn the fundamentals to the experienced wood pusher who might need practice for tournament play. The game has been cited by leading designers as one of the most influential board games of the last decade, with Polygon praising its originality. It was also the winner of the 2011 Vuoden Aikuistenpeli (Finland) for Adult game of the year.

Agricola (Revised Edition),"Help your farm to prosper in this updated, streamlined edition of the acclaimed game.",2016,1,4,4,30,120,12,3.5,Strategy,,"Agricola is a Euro-style board game created by Uwe Rosenberg. It is a worker placement game with a focus on resource management. In Agricola, players are farmers who sow, plow the fields, collect wood, build stables, buy animals, expand their farms and feed their families. After 14 rounds players calculate their score based on the size and prosperity of the household.
The game was published by Lookout Games and released at Spiel 2007, where it was voted second-best game shown at the convention, according to the Fairplay in-show voting. The game was released in English by Z-Man Games in July 2008. Playdek released an iOS conversion of the game in June 2013. A second edition of Agricola was published by Mayfair Games in May 2016.
Agricola won the Spiel des Jahres special award for ""Best complex game 2008"" and the 2008 Deutscher Spiele Preis.
It was also the game that ended Puerto Rico's run of more than five years as the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek, staying at the top of the rankings between September 2008 and March 2010. As of September 2021, Agricola is ranked 49th among all board games on BoardGameGeek, with the revised edition being ranked 75th.
A two-player version called Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.


== Gameplay ==

Players start the game with a farming couple living in a two-roomed hut. Each round, they take turns placing their family members in action spaces to get resources and improve and grow their households. Only one family member can occupy each action space within the same round, so players need to time their actions to get maximum profit while denying progress to the opponents.
The game is played in 14 rounds, divided by 6 harvests, occurring after rounds 4,7,9,11,13, and 14. At each harvest, food is grown, people are fed, and animals multiply. Players lose victory points if they have trouble feeding their family, which makes food production a major point of tension in the game.
At the end of round 14 comes the final harvest after which victory points are counted. Scoring in Agricola rewards a middle-of-the-road strategy. Players are penalized for focusing on any one aspect of the game, and stop scoring in any area they focus on too much. The player with the most balanced and prosperous farm wins.


=== Optional cards ===
To achieve variation between games, players are dealt a hand of optional cards – occupations and minor improvements. Players get additional resources and various bonuses for playing these cards. They can also get an initial direction for their strategy, based on the occupations and improvements they were dealt. Numerous expansion decks have been released to fill in gaps in gameplay and add thematic settings. The game offers a simplified 'family' variation for less involved players, in which occupation and minor improvement cards are not used.


== Differences in the revised edition ==

The original Agricola used multicolored wooden pieces of the same circular shape to denote various resources (clay, wood, reeds, etc.). The 2016 edition offered shaped wooden pieces for resources that make it easier to differentiate between the many types of resources. The new edition also included fewer optional cards – two decks for a total of 96 cards (as opposed to three decks with 308 cards in the original edition). Some reviewers praised the balance of the new decks. The revised edition is a 1-4 player game, as opposed to the original version's player count of 1–5. However, there is a 5-6 player expansion for the revised edition.


== Reimplementation ==
Rosenberg has reimplemented many mechanics from Agricola in later boardgames, in particular, Caverna (2013) and a two-player version Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small.

Lords of Waterdeep,Deploy agents and hire adventurers to expand your control over the city of Waterdeep.,2012,2,5,"3, 4",60,120,12,2.46,Strategy,,"Lords of Waterdeep is a German-style board game designed by Peter Lee and Rodney Thompson and published by Wizards of the Coast in 2012. The game is set in Waterdeep, a fictional city in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. Players take the roles of the masked rulers of Waterdeep, deploying agents and hiring adventurers to complete quests and increase their influence over the city.
In 2013, Wizards of the Coast released the only expansion to date called Scoundrels of Skullport and an iOS version of the base game in collaboration with Playdek.


== Gameplay overview ==
Lords of Waterdeep is a strategy board game for 2-5 players (up to 6 players with the expansion). Each player is of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep: who rule the city in secret, seeking to gain control of its treasures and resources. The players use their agents to recruit adventurers to complete a number of quests, which earn rewards (usually victory points and other rewards) and increases that lord's influence in the city. The various adventurer resources, represented as orange, black, purple, and white cubes, are based on the four classic D&D character classes: fighters, rogues, mages, and clerics, respectively. There are also five different types of quests, each typically favoring one type of adventurer; they are Warfare, Skullduggery, Arcana, Piety, and Commerce, which has a focus on the in-game currency.
Each player is dealt one of the Lords of Waterdeep, which is kept face down. They are allowed to look at the Lord at any time. Each Lord gives a player points at the end of the game for completing certain types of quests or controlling buildings.
Lords of Waterdeep is primarily a worker placement game with elements of card drafting. Players place their agents on various spaces around the city which allows them to take actions like collect money (gold), gather adventurers (resources), draw or play Intrigue cards (single-use special abilities), or gain Quests (the fundamental way to earn Victory Points). After eight rounds of worker placements, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.


== Contents ==
Lords of Waterdeep includes: 

a game board
a rulebook
5 cardstock player mats
121 Intrigue, Quest, and Role cards
100 wooden cubes (white, black, orange, purple)
5 agent meeples in five different colors (black, red, yellow, green, blue)
2 meeples in White and Gray representing the Ambassador and Lieutenant
5 score pieces (one of each color: black, red, yellow, green, blue)
card stock tiles and tokens representing buildings, gold coins, and victory points


== Factions ==
Each color in the game represents a faction from the Forgotten Realms. The factions are as follows:

Yellow - Knights of the Shield
Black - City Guard
Blue - Silverstars
Green - Harpers
Red - Red Sashes
Gray (Expansion color) - Gray Hands


== Scoundrels of Skullport ==
In August 2013 Wizards of the Coast released an expansion to the game titled Scoundrels of Skullport. It consists of two expansion modules – Undermountain and Skullport – that can be used to expand the base game separately or in tandem. The expansion has won the Dice Tower Award for Best Board Game Expansion of 2013.


=== Contents ===
Scoundrels of Skullport includes:

3 new game boards (Skullport, Undermountain and the corruption track)
6 agent meeples for a new gray-colored faction called the Gray Hands
1 more agent meeple for each of the colors from the base game (Black, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
25 corruption tokens
6 new Lords of Waterdeep cards
50 new Intrigue cards
60 new quest cards
24 new building tiles
16 adventure caravan tokens (4 for each of the four adventurer types, representing 5 adventurer cubes each)


=== Gameplay ===
Undermountain adds a new mechanic to the game in the form of placing resources on the game board spaces. This can be things like adventurers or even gold. Undermountain buildings are generally more rewarding than normal buildings. For example, one of the new buildings ""The Citadel of the Bloody Hand"" gives the player 4 fighters when players use it (the owner gets 2 fighters) and then the player must place 1 fighter on 2 different spaces on the board. When a player puts an agent on a space where such resources have been placed, that player gets what the space would normally give them for placing there plus any resources that are on that space. Undermountain quests also tend to be very expensive, but also very rewarding, granting up to 40 victory points at once.
Skullport adds another new mechanic to the game called corruption. There is a game board for corruption called the corruption track. There are 25 corruption tokens in the game – one token at the -1 value with three tokens on the rest up to -9. At the end of the game each corruption players have is worth a number of points equal to the highest numbered empty corruption space. So if there is 1 corruption on -5 and no corruption on -4, all corruption tokens in players taverns are worth -4 points at the end of the game. Skullport buildings, like with Undermountain, can also yield greater resources than the base game building, but they tend to also give the player corruption tokens. However, some Skullport buildings and cards will allow a player to return corruption to the track or remove corruption from the game entirely.


== Digital versions ==

An iOS version of Lords of Waterdeep was developed by Playdek and released by Wizards of the Coast on November 21, 2013. Versions for both Android and Steam were released on September 1, 2017.


== Reception ==
According to Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade, Lords of Waterdeep ""has players hiring adventurers and vying for control of a single city"".
Erik Kain of Forbes said: ""For a quick, entertaining game that requires actual thought, you could do much worse. It may not satisfy your dice-rolling, dungeon-crawling needs, but it's a wonderful game of intrigue in one of the Forgotten Realms' most notorious urban settings"".
Board Games Land have mentioned that the game ""strikes a great balance between a light strategic gameplay and accessibility"". A review at Ars Technica stated that the game is a ""perfect introduction"" to worker placement board games with simple rules.
Andrew Zimmerman Jones of Black Gate commented that ""the folks over at Dungeons & Dragons have definitely come up with a quality product in Lords of Waterdeep. After years of being an Adventurer caught in the intrigues of others, it's nice to assume the role of puppet master"". In another review in Black Gate, John ONeill said: ""Forget strategy — I want a game where I can play to my strengths. Backstabbing and subterfuge, that's what I'm good at"".

DieHard GameFan said that ""if you're looking for a new board game for the family that sates your D&D craving with a nice Euro-style board game twist, definitely pick up Lords of Waterdeep"".
Wired.com commented that ""Lords of Waterdeep is an immersive, satisfying worker placement Eurogame with a lot to offer"".

The Origins Award is commonly referred to as a Calliope, as the statuette is in the likeness of the muse of the same name. Academy members frequently shorten this name to ""Callie"".


=== Premio JdA ===
This award is for Game of the Year in Spain, ""Premio al Juego de mesa del año"" (Premio JdA), by an independent jury of game industry representatives.


=== Spiel des Jahres ===
These games are winners of the Spiel des Jahres, a German board game award widely considered the most prestigious in the industry.


==== Kennerspiel des Jahres ====
These are winners of Kennerspiel des Jahres, an expansion of the German Spiel des Jahres board game award starting in 2011. It translates to ""connoisseur/expert game of the year"" and is meant for more experienced gamers.


==== Kinderspiel des Jahres ====
The Kinderspiel des Jahres is awarded annually to the best children's game by a jury of German game critics. This award is to children's games what the Spiel des Jahres is to family games.
2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was a subcategory of the Spiel des Jahres awards known as the Sonderpreis ""Kinderspiel"" (""Special Prize for Best Children's Game""). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989–2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres.

Grand Austria Hotel,Serve guests and prepare rooms to be the best hotelier in the Viennese modern age,2015,2,4,2,60,120,12,3.23,Strategy,,"The Orient Express was a long-distance passenger luxury train service created in 1883 by the Belgian company Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) that operated until 2009. The train traveled the length of continental Europe, with terminal stations in Paris in the northwest and Istanbul in the southeast, and branches extending service to Athens, Brussels, and London.
The Orient Express embarked on its initial journey on June 5, 1883, from Paris to Vienna, eventually extending to Istanbul, thus connecting the western and eastern extremities of Europe. The route saw alterations and expansions, including the introduction of the Simplon Orient Express following the opening of the Simplon Tunnel in 1919, enhancing the service's allure and importance. Several routes concurrently used the Orient Express name, or variations. Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service, the name became synonymous with intrigue and luxury rail travel. The city names most prominently served and associated with the Orient Express are Paris and Istanbul, the original termini of the timetabled service. The rolling stock of the Orient Express changed many times.
However, post-World War II, the Orient Express struggled to maintain its preeminence amid changing geopolitical landscapes and the rise of air travel. The route stopped serving Istanbul in 1977, cut back to a through overnight service from Paris to Bucharest, which was cut back further in 1991 to Budapest, then in 2001 to Vienna, before departing for the last time from Paris on 8 June 2007. After this, the route, still called the Orient Express, was shortened to start from Strasbourg, leaving daily after the arrival of a TGV from Paris. On 14 December 2009, the Orient Express ceased to operate entirely and the route disappeared from European railway timetables, a ""victim of high-speed trains and cut-rate airlines"".
In contemporary times, the legacy of the Orient Express has been revived through private ventures like the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, initiated by James Sherwood in 1982, which offers nostalgic journeys through Europe in restored 1920s and 1930s CIWL carriages, including the original route from Paris to Istanbul. Since December 2021, an ÖBB Nightjet runs three times per week on the Paris-Vienna route, although not branded as Orient Express. Beginning in 2025, Accor will launch its own Orient Express with journeys from Paris to Istanbul.


== Train Eclair de luxe (the ""test"" train) ==

In 1882, Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian banker's son, invited guests to a railway trip of 2,000 km (1,243 mi) on his  Train Eclair de luxe (""lightning luxury train""). The train left Paris Gare de l'Est on Tuesday, 10 October 1882, just after 18:30 and arrived in Vienna the next day at 23:20. The return trip left Vienna on Friday, 13 October at 16:40 and, as planned, re-entered the Gare de Strasbourg at 20:00 on Saturday 14 October.
Georges Nagelmackers was the founder of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL), which expanded its luxury trains, travel agencies and hotels all over Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its most famous train remains the Orient Express.
The train was composed of:

Baggage car
Sleeping coach with 16 beds (with bogies)
Sleeping coach with 14 beds (3 axles)
Restaurant coach (nr. 107)
Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)
Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)
Baggage car (complete 101 ton)
The first menu on board (10 October 1882): oysters, soup with Italian pasta, turbot with green sauce, chicken ‘à la chasseur’, fillet of beef with ‘château’ potatoes, ‘chaud-froid’ of game animals, lettuce, chocolate pudding, buffet of desserts.


== Routes ==


== History ==

On 5 June 1883, the first Express d'Orient left Paris for Vienna via Munich. Vienna remained the terminus until 4 October 1883, when the route was extended to Giurgiu, Romania. At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the Danube to Ruse, Bulgaria, to pick up another train to Varna. They then completed their journey to Constantinople, as the city was still commonly called in the west at the time, by ferry. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople via rail from Vienna to Belgrade and Niš, carriage to Plovdiv, and rail again to Istanbul.
On 1 June 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris from Gare de l'Est. Istanbul, as it became known in English by the 1930s, remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the Sirkeci Terminal by the Golden Horn. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the Bosphorus to Haydarpaşa Terminal, the terminus of the Asian lines of the Ottoman Railways.

The train was officially renamed the Orient Express in 1891.
The onset of the First World War in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the Simplon Tunnel allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via Milan, Venice, and Trieste. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The Treaty of Saint-Germain contained a clause requiring Austria to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and Istanbul.

The 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the Arlberg Orient Express, which ran via the Arlberg railway between Zürich and Innsbruck to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and Athens. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their cuisine. Royalty, nobles, diplomats, business people, and the bourgeoisie in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from Calais to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.
The start of the Second World War in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German Mitropa company had run some services on the route through the Balkans, but Yugoslav Partisans frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.
Following the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between Yugoslavia and Greece prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the Bulgarian–Turkish border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to Istanbul during that time. As the Iron Curtain fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but the Communist nations increasingly replaced the Wagon-Lits cars with carriages run by their own railway services.

By 1962, the original Orient Express and Arlberg Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to Istanbul and Athens.

In 1971, the Wagon-Lits company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris–Athens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris–Istanbul service running on 19 May of that year.

The withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to Bucharest as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant that, as Paris–Budapest and Vienna–Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, a journey was only possible with changing carriages – despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was discontinued, the new final station now becoming Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared running twice a week, now operated by CFR. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris–Vienna, as a EuroNight train, though the coaches were actually attached to a regular Paris–Strasbourg express for that leg of the journey. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name Orient Express, until 8 June 2007.
With the opening of the LGV Est Paris–Strasbourg high speed rail line on 10 June 2007, the Orient Express service was further cut back to Strasbourg–Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name, but lost the train numbers 262/263 which it had borne for decades.
The remains of the original train had a convenient connection to the Strasbourg-Paris TGV, but due to the less flexible prices the route became less attractive. In the final years through coaches between Vienna and Karlsruhe (continuing first to Dortmund, then to Amsterdam, and finally to Frankfurt) were attached. The last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on 10 December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.
On 13 December 2021, an ÖBB Nightjet train began running three times per week on the Paris-Vienna route, although it is not branded as Orient Express.

== Privately run trains using the name ==
In 1976, the Swiss travel company Intraflug AG first rented, then later bought several CIWL-carriages. They were operated as the Nostalgic Istanbul Orient Express by Seattle-based Society Expeditions. The route went first from Zürich to Istanbul, following the route of the Arlberg Orient Express. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient Express was celebrated by extending the route to run from Paris to Istanbul. The train ceased operations in 2007.


=== Belmond ===

In 1982, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express was established by businessman James Sherwood as a private venture and is currently owned and operated by Belmond. It operates restored 1920s and 1930s carriages on routes around Europe. It also offered a connecting service from London to Folkestone on the British Pullman, using similarly restored vintage British Pullman cars, but it was announced in April 2023 that due to complications ensuing from Brexit this would cease, and travelers from London would have to take Eurostar to Paris in order to join the Orient Express. The Venice Simplon-Orient-Express operates from March to December and is aimed at leisure travellers. Tickets start at US$3,262 per person and it operates on multiple different routes most notably Paris-Istanbul via Vienna and Budapest. Despite its name, the train runs via the Brenner Pass instead of the Simplon tunnel. Belmond also offers a similarly themed luxury train in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, called the Eastern and Oriental Express. Sherwood also operated a chain of Orient Express-branded luxury hotels, licensed from SNCF, owner of the Orient Express branding. The chain was renamed Belmond in 2014 when the branding license ended.


=== Accor ===

In 2017, Accor purchased a 50% stake in the Orient Express brand from SNCF for the right to use the name. In 2018, Accor began renovation work on 17 CIWL carriages from the defunct Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express, which date back to the 1920s and 1930s, to create their own Orient Express. It will carry passengers between Paris and Istanbul beginning in 2025. They will also offer journeys around Italy on La Dolce Vita Orient Express beginning in April 2025.


== In popular culture ==

The glamour and rich history of the Orient Express has frequently lent itself to the plot of books and films and as the subject of television documentaries.

Pandemic Legacy: Season 0,Work together during the Cold War to prevent a Soviet bio-threat.,2020,2,4,,45,60,14,3.01,Strategy,  Thematic,"A legacy game is a variant of tabletop board games in which the game itself is designed, through various mechanics, to change permanently over the course of a series of sessions.


== History ==
Game designer Rob Daviau claims to have come up with the idea at a work meeting after jokingly asking why the murderous characters in Clue are always invited back to dinner. Realizing that each new game resets, Daviau thought about what it would be like if everyone would remember who the murderer was, and he pitched the idea of a Clue legacy game to Hasbro.

While that idea was rejected, Daviau was later asked to use the mechanic in a new version of Risk. Risk Legacy was released in 2011 and was his first game to use this format.
Daviau followed up with an award-winning Pandemic variant, Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, which was released in 2015 to positive reviews and praised as a leap forward in modern board game design. Daviau continues to develop legacy games and co-developed a mechanic, the Echo System, to retain permanent changes through subsequent games in a franchise.
Daviau cited his work on Betrayal at House on the Hill (which was later adapted into a legacy version) and Trivial Pursuit: DVD – Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition as predecessors to the legacy idea. The latter was designed in such a way that pre-programmed games sorted the cards by difficulty. This caused some vocal backlash as the game was perceived by many to have a more definite end than other versions.


== Common mechanics and themes ==
Legacy games are designed to be played over the course of a campaign, usually with the same players, and permanently change over time. As such they have been compared to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. New rules can be introduced as the campaign goes on, allowing for the game to expand both mechanically and thematically. Games can use the expanding campaign as a mode of storytelling; Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 uses a three-act structure to tell its story. Daviau describes legacy games as ""experiential"" in contrast to traditional games, which are ""repeatable"". He compared his legacy games to that of a concert where you ""buy a ticket for an experience"" while Haoran Un of Kotaku describes the idea as ""avant-garde performance art"".
Legacy games break certain covenants that players expect from traditional board games. Permanent, physical changes can occur to components based on game outcomes and player choices. For instance players might be instructed to write names on cards, place stickers on the game board, or destroy some components. This causes each copy of the game to be unique at the end and has earned the legacy genre criticism in that there is a finite amount of replayability. Some games have been designed to be replayable with refill packs or non-permanent stickers while others are still playable with the final permanent changes once the campaign is over.

Caylus,Entrepreneurs pay workers & bribe an official to build a Ch?teau & gain royal favor.,2005,2,5,3,60,150,12,3.8,Strategy,,"Caylus is a strategy oriented, German-style board game designed by William Attia and independently published in 2005 by Ystari in France and England, and Rio Grande Games in North America. Caylus has a mix of building, producing, planning, and bargaining — without direct conflict or dice-rolling mechanics.
A card-game version, Caylus Magna Carta, was published in 2007, as well as a limited premium version of the game, with redesigned medieval-styled artwork and metallic coins. An iOS version of the game was launched in 2012.


== Game mechanics ==
The goal of Caylus is to amass the most prestige points by constructing buildings and by working on the castle of Caylus in medieval France.
Caylus does not include the random elements found in many board games, such as cards and dice. The only exceptions to this are the placement of the six neutral buildings (leading to 720 possible starting configurations) and the initial turn order, both of which are determined randomly at the beginning of the game. However, the effect of random initial turn order is minimal because players whose turn is later start off with a higher amount of money.
The basic mechanics of the game include:


=== Resources ===
Resource cubes of five types: food (pink), wood (brown), cloth (purple), stone (gray), and gold (yellow). These are used to build buildings and the castle.
Workers: Each player has six workers, which can be placed on buildings to harvest resources, construct more buildings, build the castle, and more.
Bailiff: The bailiff moves either one or two spaces from his starting spot on every turn in the game. The pace of his movement can be influenced by the players through the Provost (see below). When the bailiff reaches a pre-determined space, he triggers the conclusion of a phase of construction of Caylus castle (see below). When the bailiff reaches the third such space, the game is over.
Provost: The provost indicates by his position which of the workers placed by the players will be allowed to work on any given turn: workers ahead of him are not allowed to work. The provost's position can be influenced by the players with money (see below) or with special spaces on the board. Furthermore, if at the end of a turn the provost ends up on or behind the bailiff, then the bailiff will only move one space forward that round. If the provost is in front of the bailiff, then the bailiff moves ahead two spaces, thus shortening the game.
Money: Caylus currency is called the denier. Deniers are used to pay workers, influence the provost to allow workers to work or to block opponents' workers from working, use the jousting field to gain royal favors (see below), and build certain buildings.
Neutral buildings: Six neutral buildings are randomly placed at the start of the game; along with initial turn order, this is the only source of randomness in the game.
Player buildings: By placing a worker on a construction building, a player can construct a new building; each new building has a fixed cost of 2 to 8 resource cubes (some costs being a white wildcard, allowing payment of any resource type). Once built, all players can use the new building, but the original builder gets a bonus every time an opponent uses it.
Building the castle: By placing a worker in the castle, a player can send a ""batch"" of three different resource cubes (one of which must be food) to help construct the castle of Caylus and reap prestige points and royal favors.
Royal favors: Players who contribute to the royal cause by building the castle, using the jousting field, or constructing certain buildings are granted royal favors. In the story of the game, prestige and royal favors are granted by King Philip the Fair. Royal favors can take the form of prestige points, money, resources, or discounted, unblockable access to construct buildings.  These royal favors can often be the deciding factor in the game, when used cleverly.


=== Turns ===
A turn in Caylus consists of 8 phases:

Income. Each player receives a standard income of 2 deniers, plus any income for Residential buildings s/he owns (or prestige buildings that provide income).
Placement of workers. According to the turn order, players take turns placing their workers on unoccupied spaces (with some exceptions). Each worker placement costs 1 denier. The players may pass once they have placed all the workers they want (or can afford). Every time a player passes, the cost of placing additional workers on that turn increases by 1 for the other players.
Activation of special buildings. The special buildings (the first 5 buildings after the castle, but before the bridge) are activated, and their effects are applied.
The provost moves. Each player (in order of passing) has the opportunity to move the provost backward or forward by paying 1 denier per space, up to a maximum of 3. After this phase, any workers that are located after the provost are removed, as they are not allowed to work.
Activation of buildings.  Starting with the first neutral (pink) building after the bridge, all remaining buildings activate in order.
Building of the castle. Players build the section of the castle (dungeon, walls, or tower) that is currently under construction.  This is done in the order in which players placed their workers to build the castle.
The end of the turn. The bailiff moves along the road. He moves forward 2 spaces if the provost is ahead of him, and 1 space if the provost is on the same space as he or behind him. He never moves backwards. Once the bailiff has been moved, the provost is placed on the same square as the bailiff.
Scoring of sections. If the bailiff reaches a scoring point, or a section of the castle is completed, then that section is scored.
The player who is at the top of the turn order starts the next turn.
The game ends when the bailiff reaches the Tower scoring point, or when all the tower spaces have been built (automatically triggering the scoring of the Tower section). After the final prestige points are awarded for any leftover money and resources, the player with the most prestige points wins the game.


== Awards ==
Caylus initially gained public acclaim when it was rated the number one game of the October 2005 game fair in Essen, Germany by a public vote conducted by Fairplay Magazine.  It quickly rose to become one of the most discussed and top-rated games on BoardGameGeek, a popular online board gaming forum.
Caylus also received the Trictrac d'or 2005 award from the eponymous French boardgame website.
With the international attention gained via BoardGameGeek and Essen 2005, the first printing of Caylus sold out in December 2005.  A second printing was released in February 2006, including new cardboard coins to replace the gray plastic tiddlywinks-style coins from the original release.  The second edition also includes the jeweler as a standard stone building tile (it was previously a promotional tile) and numerous graphic design changes to clarify certain rules.
Although Caylus was not nominated for the 2006 Spiel des Jahres, the jury awarded it a special prize (Sonderpreis Komplexes Spiel) for the best complex game of 2006.  Caylus won first prize in the 2006 Deutscher Spiele Preis and Nederlandse Spellenprijs, and won the 2006 Golden Geek Awards for Best Game and Best Gamer's Game.

Twilight Imperium: Third Edition,"Epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power.",2005,3,6,6,180,240,14,4.25,Strategy,  Thematic,"Twilight Imperium is a strategy board game produced by Fantasy Flight Games in the genre of science fiction and space opera. It was designed by Christian T. Petersen and was first released in 1997. The game is in its fourth edition (2017), which has large changes over previous editions. It is known for the length of its gameplay (often greater than six hours), and its in-depth strategy (including military, political, technological and trade).


== Game background ==
The game's premise is a large-scale space opera. It is set in the unstable power vacuum left after the centuries-long decline and collapse of the previously dominant Lazax race. The old galactic central capital, Mecatol Rex, located in the center of the map is maintained by custodians who maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council. Players assume the roles of rising empires on the fringes of the galaxy, vying for military and political control, until one finally becomes sufficiently dominant to take over as a new galactic emperor.


== Development history ==


=== First edition ===
The first edition of Twilight Imperium was conceived by Christian T. Petersen while working as an importer of European comics. Drawing from a background of working at a Danish game importer, Petersen designed, published, and assembled the first edition of the game single-handedly. The final version of the first edition debuted at the Origins Game Fair in 1997. Fantasy Flight set up demos of the game in a high-traffic corridor to garner more attention, and ended up selling out of all of their available copies in under two days.


=== Second edition ===
The second edition of Twilight Imperium was published in 2000. It was the first edition of the game to feature art by Scott Schomburg and Brian Schomburg. It also introduced plastic spaceship pieces, replacing cardboard tokens that were used in the first edition.


=== Third edition ===
The third edition of Twilight Imperium, published in 2004, was designed at roughly the same time that Petersen was also working on A Game of Thrones, and his desire was to emphasize similar narrative development in this new edition's gameplay. He also looked to the mechanics of Eurogames like Puerto Rico for inspiration of how to represent complex mechanisms simply. The game box proved to be so large that wholesale distributors had to purchase custom-sized shipping cartons in order to make them fit.


=== Fourth edition ===
Development of Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition began in 2015. The original plan for the game was to seek funding on the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter, releasing a product with an MSRP of approximately US$250. Ideas pitched for this version included featuring only the six original races but each with unique ship designs, as well as presenting Mecatol Rex as centrepiece figure instead of a tile. However, this plan was scrapped in the summer of 2016 as the features were proving too costly to create within their budget. The revised version included all previous species introduced into Twilight Imperium, and was released at Gen Con in August 2017. Fourth edition was initially intended as a stand-alone game without any variant rules and expansions, but the expansion Prophecy of Kings was introduced in November 2020.


== Components ==

The game consists of cardboard map tiles, cards, plastic units, cardboard counters, and player sheets. The map is built from hexagonal tiles, each showing up to three planets, empty space, or a red-bordered system containing an obstacle (with additional types added in the expansions). The centre tile is always Mecatol Rex, with the remainder of the galaxy built out in concentric rings.
Plastic playing pieces represent various starship classes and ground forces. Players are limited to the number of playing pieces provided with the game, except for fighters and ground forces. Counters are included for record-keeping, including command tokens, control markers, trade goods, and extra fighter and ground force counters. Cards are used to track planet ownership, trade agreements, technologies, public objectives, secret objectives, special actions, and policy voting agendas.


== Gameplay ==

Three to six (eight, with 'Prophecy of Kings') players can play, with games typically taking more than six hours to complete (approx. 1.5 hours per player), although players new to the game can take longer. The game works on a 'victory points' system such that players earn points by completing a combination of public and secret objectives.


=== Setup ===
Each player randomly selects a race to control. Either a pre-designed map can be used, or players can generate a map via a pre-game mechanic whereby each takes turns in placing map tiles to construct a galaxy map with Mecatol Rex at the centre and home systems around the periphery.


==== Factions ====

Players can choose from several alien factions (up to 25 in the 4th edition) to play as. Anywhere from three to six (or eight, with the 'Prophecy of Kings' expansion) of these factions will appear in a game, depending on the number of players. Each faction has unique abilities, home planets, starter units and technologies. Additionally, each faction has distinct characters and themes, and they each specialize in particular areas of the game, such as trade, combat, technology, or politics.
Faction list below:


=== Rounds ===
Play consists of up to 10 rounds (though usually less, depending on how quickly players gain victory points) -- each of which contain several turns. In each round, players choose a strategy card, which provides large bonuses to a particular gameplay mechanic and determines the order in which the players take turns during the round.
Players take turns to perform actions (building units, moving units, using strategy cards, using special action cards). Players are limited in the number of actions they can take during a round by their supply of command tokens, which are divided between strategy (used to access the secondary action of other players' strategy cards), fleet supply (limiting the number of ships that can occupy a system), and command pools (used for tactical actions). Players continue taking actions in turn order until each player has passed.


=== Units and combat ===
Units are purchased throughout the game using the resources from occupied planets. Combat is fought in rounds with each unit rolling one or more 10-sided dice to attempt to score ""hits"" on the enemy player, who is allowed a counter-attack with all their units before choosing which units are destroyed.


=== Politics ===
Politics and discussion play an important role in Twilight Imperium. Agendas are voted on at multiple points throughout the game, with each player's voting power being proportional to the quality and quantity of planets they control. Laws that are successfully passed can greatly modify certain game mechanics and thus change the flow of the game.


=== Scoring ===
At the end of each round, players have the opportunity to score victory points for a public goal that has been revealed and/or for a secret objective assigned to each player at the start of the game. The first player to achieve 10 victory points is declared the new Emperor and wins the game. After the 6th round, the game also has a mechanism where the game has a chance of ending on any subsequent round and the highest scoring player at that point declared the winner.


== Online implementation ==

A community-made implementation of the game was created in Tabletop Simulator. It stems from a fan-version of the third edition game called ""Shattered Ascension"" that was built in Tabletop Simulator in 2011 using the same components but a variant ruleset and gained a significant online community. After the publication of game's fourth edition in 2017, a similar Tabletop Simulator implementation was created in 2018 and is now used for online tournaments.


== Expansions, variants and optional rules ==


=== Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition: Shattered Empire ===
Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion called Shattered Empire in December 2006. It includes two new sets of playing pieces and additional system tiles, expanding maximum player number to eight. It also introduced several rules-fixes to address common criticisms of the base game.


=== Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition: Shards of the Throne ===
Fantasy Flight Games released a second expansion called Shards of the Throne in May 2011, with additions including new factions, technologies, scenarios and units.


=== Variant rulesets ===
The base game and its expansions come with several optional rules and the counters necessary to play them out. The simplest variant is the long game, where the winner must score 14 victory points, rather than 10. However, most variants are intended to allow players to customise the game-play in favour of their preferred mechanics. For example, there are alternative variants of all the strategy cards, which can drastically alter how players organise their turns. Some rule variants introduce new units, whilst others can introduce completely new mechanics, such as race-specific leaders and diplomats, or random encounters for the first player to land on each neutral planet.


=== Twilight Imperium 4th Edition: Prophecy of Kings ===
Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion for 4th Edition Twilight Imperium in November 2020. The expansion contains seven new factions, some of which are based in the lore of Twilight Imperium's previous editions. It also brings in many of the systems and units that were first contained in 3rd edition. A new layer of technologies has been introduced giving more flexibility on how players choose their technology paths. The expansion also includes the Omega updates that were published in April 2020. It does not include any variant rules and is intended to be fully incorporated into the base game.


=== Twilight Imperium 4th Edition: Twilight Codex ===
The Codex is the official web based publication, published by Fantasy Flight Games that highlights rule updates and showcases new content for Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition and eventually the Prophecy of Kings expansion. The predominant figure behind the codex is Dane Beltrami, the head developer of Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition.


== Differences between editions ==


=== Third edition vs previous versions ===
The third edition significantly changed many of the game mechanics. While some of the core elements remained the same, the game as a whole was completely revamped. Here are some of the more significant differences:

In 2E, only the Hacan, Letnev, N'orr, Jol-Nar, Sol, and Xxcha were playable races. The Mentak and Yssaril were introduced in the Hope's End expansion as new playable races. The L1Z1X were present as non-player hostile invaders, introduced to gameplay via some of the events. The Naalu were completely new to the 3rd Edition (although it first appeared in the first edition expansion: The Outer Rim). While the races present in both games kept the same basic flavor and feel, the racial abilities changed between editions.
In 2E, the game rounds were broken into phases: the political, production, movement, invasion, and technology steps. Each player had equal access to these phases every round. In 3E, these phases were largely spread out among the strategy cards, coupled with the new threaded activation sequence.
In 2E, players collected credits as tangible money that could be spent from round to round. 3E's spending is mostly done by exhausting planets, though the trade-good concept does allow some limited form of savable liquid assets.
In 2E, the only spaceships that could be built were cruisers, carriers, dreadnoughts, and fighters. 3E introduced destroyers (cheaper and weaker than cruisers, but more mobile than fighters), and war suns (expensive and powerful super ships).
While most of the technologies were ported from 2E to 3E, many of the effects changed significantly (largely to fit with the 3E sequence better).
Politics in 2E was done at the beginning of each game round by drawing a card from a political card deck, and voting on the agenda. Some of these cards were events which automatically affected the game in some way (such as introducing hostile L1Z1X forces). In 3E, the concept of ""events"" was removed completely.
In 2E, players achieved victory by progressing along a fixed set of objectives, largely centered around the number of resources, influence, and planets controlled, as well as technologies. In 3E, players instead try to achieve victory points by completing objectives revealed during the game; these objectives could change from game to game.
The tiles, cards, and playing pieces in the 3E are noticeably larger in size than their 2E counterparts.


=== Fourth edition vs previous versions ===
Players now have 17 factions available to choose from, including factions that were only available in the expansions for earlier editions such as the Ghosts of Creuss, the Mentak Coalition, the Naalu Collective, and the Yssaril Tribes. The number of factions has been increased to 25 with the Prophecy of Kings expansion and the Twilight Codex Vol. III. 
The phases of play in each round are now strategy, action, status, and the agenda phase. The agenda phase is added only after a player has taken Mecatol Rex.
In the strategy phase, players choose a Strategy Card to use in the upcoming action phase. The strategy cards now control many of the fundamental mechanics that were tied to a phase in the 3rd Edition. As a result, players may be in competition for a particular strategy card, and a taking a particular Strategy Card may be necessary for a player to achieve certain objectives. The Strategy Cards confer abilities such as the purchase of additional command counters, changing who is the Speaker and thus will get first pick of the strategy cards in the next round, refilling commodities for trade, building Planetary Defense Systems (PDS') or Space Docks, researching technology, drawing additional Action Cards or Secret Objectives, or scoring an objective early (in the action phase, while all other players must wait for the status phase).
In the action phase, players take turns expanding their empire by moving ships, building units, engaging in trade and combat, researching technology, making deals, using their Strategic and Action Cards, and attempting to complete the requirements for public and secret objectives. The player's initiative order (the turn order) is determined by a player's lowest number strategy card, e.g. a player with the leadership card (no.1) will go first and a player with the imperial Card (no.8) will go last. The action phase continues until every player has chosen to pass, and once a player has passed they cannot make any more tactical actions. Each strategy card has a primary and a secondary ability - the bearer of a strategy card uses only the primary and the other players may only use the secondary. So that no player ever misses out on the powerful abilities of the strategy cards, the bearer of a strategy card may not pass and end their action phase until they have used their strategy card, and all other players always have the option to use the secondary ability of a strategy card once activated, even if they passed on a previous turn.
The status phase is a book-keeping and maintenance phase. Players score public and secret objectives in the same initiative order from the action phase (not clockwise from the Speaker), reveal the next public objective, draw action cards, remove and regain command tokens (and may redistribute command tokens among their tactical, strategic, and fleet pools), ready all exhausted cards (including the strategy and technology and planetary cards), repair any damaged units, and return the strategy cards to a common play area.
The agenda phase has replaced the politics phase. Once a player has taken Mecatol Rex, it is appended as the fourth phase after the status phase to each round. In the agenda phase, players convene the galactic council on Mecatol Rex and vote on two agendas. Agendas are either Laws (permanent changes to the current game's mechanics, such as allowing all players to build War Suns without needing to research the qualifying technologies) and Directives (a one-time effect such as each player drawing a secret objective, or giving a victory point to the player in last place). Each player casts votes by exhausting their planets for its influence score (where each point of influence is one vote), and may spend as many as they have for the agendas, or abstain from voting. Players may not spend trade goods as influence for casting votes in this phase, but the voting (the active) player is free to offer deals - Promissory Notes, commodities or trade goods - to influence or purchase another player's vote. Players are also allowed to make deals and transactions during the agenda phase whether they share borders or not, allowing for the exchange of promissory notes, and commodities and trade goods. Once both agendas have been voted on, the players refresh all their exhausted planets so they have the resources and influence and technology specialties available for the action phase in the next round.
The technology tree has been simplified. Rather than a confusing flow chart of pre-requisites, technological advancement is through four linear branches, and players can upgrade most of the available units by satisfying pre-requisites in the four branches.
Trade has been simplified. Players now exchange faction commodities which become trade goods when another player acquires them. Instead of requiring trade agreements, the active player is now allowed to trade their commodities with neighbors (anyone they share a border with) during their turn.

Dominion: Intrigue,"Enlist torturers, swindlers, and saboteurs to gain wealth and dominate the kingdom.",2009,2,6,3,30,30,13,2.42,Strategy,,"Dystopian Wars is a Victorian super science-fiction miniature wargame with steampunk elements published and manufactured by Warcradle Studios. It is set in an alternate timeline in 1870. In this world, technological advances have occurred over a century before they would in our timeline, which has had dire consequences for the conduct of warfare as technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable.
Dystopian Wars uses a range of resin models in 1:1200 scale.
The original IP for Dystopian Wars was created by Neil Fawcett and Alain Padfield and published by Spartan Games. The original artwork was created by Sally Taylor and the original background - over 250,000 words - was written by writers Neil Fawcett and Franco Sammarco. The creative genius behind the first raft of superbly detailed models was Chris Drew and the team was later expanded with Chris Peacey. In total this team of model makers created an array of miniatures in 1/1200th scale covering the ground, air and naval theatres of war.
For many years Dystopian forged its way in the arena of Victorian super science fiction. Following the 1.1 version of the rulebook games designer Derek Sinclair joined the creative team, heralding a surge in the expansion of the game. Later the writing team was expanded with the addition of Josh Le Cheminant. One of the most notable aspects of the game was the way in which the rules attempted to embrace three theatres of war simultaneously.
With the closure of Spartan Games the IP for the game, along with other games such as Firestorm Armada, were put up for sale and were acquired by Warcradle Studios. At this time the company merged its own steampunk game product with that of Dystopian Wars. The game is now being expanded with new rules and models.


== Background ==
In 1845, scientist Barnabas Draynes Sturgeon led an expedition to Antarctica searching for a rumoured treasure trove of technology of unknown origin, either alien or from a lost technologically advanced civilisation. His expedition found it in a location called The Vault. Sturgeon wanted to use this technology to bring about an age of peace and bring about a scientific utopia. Instead he was betrayed by an assistant, Markov. Markov fled to Russia where he sold the technology to other nations, such as Tesla directed energy weapons to the Prussian Empire, and helped modernize the Tsar's armies. Sturgeon founded the Covenant of Antarctica to continue his mission of scientific progress, and to end the terrible war that has been unleashed by the new technologies.
Because of Markov's betrayal and the discoveries of the Vault, the nations now go to war with highly advanced vehicles and weapons. Tanks the size of castles, rockets, airships, submarines and robots all march in this new industrial war. Particle beams and lasers are used as offensive weaponry while nuclear fusion is used to propel tanks, airships, planes, naval vessels, rockets and submarines. The Covenant of Antarctica practices both covert operations and military intervention in the affairs of other nations to ensure that no side develops nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, but its technologically advance forces are hard pressed to contain the Great Powers. Gravity Nullification Engines allow ships to skim above the surface, and Time Dilation technology permits the teleportation of units across short distances. Burrowing vehicles vie for control of battlegrounds with massive mobile airfields, whilst in the skies above, flying sky fortresses and warships engage in deadly duels for aerial supremacy.
There are some political developments that also preceded comparative events in our own timeline, or else diverged. The earliest point of divergence is that Commonwealth of England industrialised in 1650 under the guidance of Oliver Cromwell, although the monarchy is apparently restored as normal later on, as Queen Victoria rules the Kingdom of Britannia in the Dystopian Wars present. Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, died in 1804, leading to a collapse of the French Empire into civil war. The Prussian Empire was strong enough at this point to launch an aggressive campaign of expansion, analogous to the Napoleonic Wars, that ended in defeat at the hands of the British Army at Waterloo in 1815. Despite this defeat, where the first landships (massive tanks) were used in battle, the Prussian Empire remained strong and forged a united Germany sooner than occurred in our timeline (including Austria).  Italy, whilst not unified, is a similarly powerful League dominated by the 'Tetrarchy of Princes': the Doge of the Republic of Venice, and the Kings of the three Kingdoms, Sardinia, Lombardy and Sicily. The League took advantage of the Prussian expansion and the 1804 collapse of Austria to take back many Italian territories from other European powers. Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III in our time line) was elected president of the Republique of France in 1866, not 1848 as in our timeline.
Japan, as the Empire of the Blazing Sun, broke its geographical isolation earlier than was the case in our world and occupied Korea sooner than 1910, suffering a major defeat but learning in the process. The South won the American Civil War in this timeline, a war fought over mineral wealth not slavery (which had been abolished in 1825), and reconfigured the Union as the Federated States of America in 1864. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is not part of the Tsarist Russian Empire analogue, the Russian Coalition. Egypt overthrew French rule in 1804 and Australia is not a British colony, although India and New Zealand are. The Socialist Union of South America formed as a barrier to the expansionist objectives of the FSA and is communist in ideology. The FSA also took over the Caribbean islands and Central America, but not the Philippines, which implies that the Spanish Empire was far weaker than it was in our own timeline. The Chinese Federation and Ottoman Empire are stronger political entities in this timeline than they were in our world due to effective leadership.


== Gameplay ==
Dystopian Wars is a Victorian sci-fi game that builds upon the core aspects established by the fantasy naval game, Uncharted Seas, and the space combat game, Firestorm Armada. These systems have been advanced to allow for simultaneous combat in all three traditional theatres of war - naval, armoured and aerial.
A game of Dystopian Wars will usually last approximately two hours, but this will depend on how many players are taking part and the amount of models being utilised. Resin and pewter models from the Dystopian Wars range are used to play the game. The rules accommodate small-scale sorties into enemy territory, border skirmishes, and huge, history-defining battles. The rules can also accommodate for large multiplayer game.
The rules include the optional use of a deck of 52 Game Cards designed to improve overall game play by introducing more tactical options and by injecting some eccentric Victorian atmosphere.


== Major Nations ==
The Great Powers are nations that are currently playable and available to buy for the Dystopian Wars game. They each have a Naval and Armoured Battle Group, and a variety of other units to field.


=== Kingdom of Britannia ===
The world's greatest maritime Empire, the Kingdom of Britannia, has firmly ruled the great oceans since the decisive defeat of the Prussian Empire under Heinrich Otto at the beginning of the 19th century.
In the process, Britannian colonists and military forces have come into contact with, and gone to war against, numerous opponents. These have ranged from opportunistic French and Prussian expeditions, to other nations such as the Kingdom of Burma and even dissenting imperial subjects such as the Australian rebels.
Through it all, however, the Kingdom has successfully retained the bulk of its holdings, and even steadily expanded them, especially around the coasts of Africa in concert with its small but dependable ally, the Kingdom of Portugal.


=== Prussian Empire ===
Despite its fall from grace under the paranoid and megalomaniacal Emperor Heinrich Otto at the beginning of the century, the Prussian Empire has endured and prospered in the ensuing decades.
Through a combination of economic and military might and pursuit of a shrewd diplomatic strategy, the Prussian Empire has come to dominate Central and Eastern Europe, and even exert considerable influence in the western and southern portions of the continent.
Now under attack from the east and pressured from the west and south, the time has come for the Prussians to throw back their rivals, make their mark upon the world and cement their dominance of Europe for another century.
Austria invaded Prussia at the end of the century.


=== Federated States of America ===
One of the world's newest great powers, the Federated States of America, has only existed since 1864. Prior to that, North America was dominated by the United States, composed of a combination of old Britannian, French and Spanish territories, and a large portion of what had been Mexico.
However, in the early 1860s, a dispute over the ownership of strategic industrial resources caused a political rift between the United States government and a large number of individual states. This culminated in a bid by the US federal government to use the United States military to enforce this ownership.
Led by Texas and Mississippi, the original targets of the US government's ire thanks to their rich reserves of oil and uranium respectively, the dissenting states seceded from the Union. They formed what was then called the Confederacy.
The two sides went to war in 1860 for dominance over the nation. The Confederacy eventually won out in 1864, thanks to assistance from the Kingdom of Britannia. Nathanial Adams of the New Federalist Party, elected president that year, proclaimed the Federated States of America, and set about the process of turning the nation into a world power.


=== Empire of the Blazing Sun ===
At the cutting edge of industrial and scientific research and development, yet steeped in the traditions of a bygone age, the Empire of the Blazing Sun has risen from nowhere to challenge the dominance of the established powers.
Almost an unknown quantity until recently, the Empire of the Blazing Sun came of age in the 1830s when, after a long and gruelling war, it took possession of the Kingdom of Korea. Among other boons gained after the conquest was the secret of poison gas manufacture.
Now, as the 'Little Giant' of the Pacific seeks to expand its influence, it has for the first time encountered the industrial and commercial agencies of the established powers. As much as the Empress wishes to avoid conflict, it appears that the Empire of the Blazing Sun must employ force as well as words to win their arguments.


=== Covenant of Antarctica ===
The most enigmatic of the world's great powers was, for a few years, celebrated as a great standard-bearer for scientific and technological progress. Its founder, Lord Barnabas D. Sturgeon, discovered the extraordinary Vault, a vast repository of amazing technology. He was to use the materials and scientific wonders contained within the Vault to found his own country at the foot of the world in 1857.
For a few years thereafter, the Covenant was globally feted, with embassies in every nation, and visiting teachers and lecturers at almost all of the great universities and academies. Sturgeon and his circle of advisors shared the bounty of the Vault, but as with all things that begin perfect, corruption and betrayal soon sets in.
The Covenant  even purchased South Georgia Island from Britannia, turning it into a city called The Gateway, as a means for foreigners to visit the new nation. But then, in 1866, the Covenant suddenly enclosed its borders, and Sturgeon, without explanation, halted the flow of knowledge.
Almost all of the Antarctican academics left their posts and returned home. Embassies were either reduced to a skeleton staff or simply shut down. Although it is still possible to travel to The Gateway, only genuine migrants seeking citizenship are allowed to travel onwards to Antarctica proper. These people are not seen again - it is widely supposed that the nation's borders are now closed in both directions.


=== Republique of France ===
The resolute Republique of France and its people have undergone many tribulations since their experiences in the early 19th century. Once it was an imperial power that looked set to challenge the Prussians as masters of Western Europe, and the Britannians as rulers of the oceans. But these dreams were shattered by a series of catastrophic events at the dawn of the century.
Such was the speed of its fall from grace that France, which in 1804 had dictated the fate of other nations, had by 1815 been virtually reduced to the role of spectator to events. The future of Europe and a considerable part of the world besides was decided on the fields of Waterloo, but the Republique's fate was out of its hands entirely.
However, since that time, the Republique had not languished in despair. Having reached, as they saw it, the very lowest depths of hopelessness, the French spent the following decades dedicating all their efforts and energies into rebuilding their nation and its glory.
Now, as the 1870s dawn, and the world is gripped by crisis, France sees at last the chance to regain its rightful place as a great power. The self-satisfied, the naysayers and the complacent, at home and abroad, who in the past have sought to write off the Republique's fortunes will soon be proven very wrong.


=== Russian Coalition ===
The vast expanse of the Russian Coalition dominates more than one sixth of the world's entire landmass. What is all the more remarkable is that, with the exception of the distant and rugged Oblast of Alaska, across the Bering Sea, all of this vast empire is one contiguous realm. It is the product of several centuries of military conquest and political and royal union.
The Russian Coalition has existed as a single political union since the crowning of Ivan IV - known as Ivan Grozny: 'the Terrible' or 'the Fearsome' - as the first true Tsar of all Russia in the 16th century. Known as the Russian Empire before 1800, it has steadily expanded its borders, most notably under the guiding hand of Romanov Tsar Peter the Great.
Peter in particular was determined to make his empire strong through modern means. He toured Europe during his reign, determined to furnish his empire with the many technological wonders of the new industrial age, especially those he saw in Britain - steam power, early iron-plated boats and mechanised factories.
However, Romanov rule is now but a distant memory. Tsar Vladimir I Nikolaevich of the House of Rurik-Novy - New Rurik - rules now. The means by which his family achieved imperial power, and their exercise of it, has defined the modern Russian Coalition.


== Alliance Nations ==
The Alliance Nations are secondary powers established in the Dystopian Wars timeline. Players can field a variety of these units as accompanying forces to the Great Powers. The following Alliance Nations have already seen some of their units released.


=== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
Sandwiched between the Prussian Empire and the Russian Coalition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has always stood in a precarious position in the volatile political intrigues and territorial disputes of central and Eastern Europe. The Commonwealth is not inconsiderable in size – its lands stretch from the Baltic to the Black Sea coasts, with Riga its northernmost city and Odessa the southernmost. Formed from a union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Commonwealth has a unique system of governance; the elective monarchy. The ruling King of the Commonwealth is elected by a parliamentary body known as the Sejm, which holds the real political power in the nation – in the past several kings have been dismissed from office by the Sejm which felt that their rule was proceeding counter to the best interests of the Commonwealth.


=== Dominion of Canada ===
The Dominion of Canada has long been one of Britannia's most important imperial possessions. The Canadians have a reputation for making tough and hardy soldiers, who adapt well to battlefields around the world.
Canadian designers have benefitted from contact with American scientists and engineers, thanks to Britannia's long-standing cordial relationship with the Federated States of America. They have also been able to adopt a few aspects of French engineering from sympathetic expatriates based in Quebec.


=== Kingdom of Denmark ===
Alone amongst the other Scandinavian nations, the Danes have preserved their independence despite being almost wholly surrounded by the Prussian Empire and within easy striking distance of both the Russian Coalition and the Kingdom of Britannia.
The Danes bargained their Norwegian lands to Heinrich Otto in 1810 in order to keep their homeland free. Since then, as allies of the Prussians they have prospered and Erik VIII, King of the Danes since 1852 has reinforced this situation.


=== Protectorate of Belgium ===
A key ally of the Republique of France since the grim year of 1816, the Protectorate of Belgium has historically been a region of great strategic importance to the three Great Powers. None are more aware of this than the Belgians themselves, and the nation is studded with fortifications built up over scores of years in an attempt to limit the damage caused by frequent wars.
Unfortunately, a bitter civil war between supporters of Belgium's current ruler, Protector Jean-Paul Vermeirens and the Coronet, a rebel faction led by Godeleva, self-styled 'Queen of the Belgians' has torn the nation apart. Although Vermeirens retains control of most of the country, East and West Flanders declared for the Royalists, along with most of Belgium's navy.
Vermierens asked for aid from the French and eventually the Prussians, despite lingering Belgian distrust of the latter. Meanwhile, the Royalists have sought help from the Kingdom of Britannia and its allies and the wider war has now engulfed Belgium.
The Belgian military forces are strongest on land, deploying heavily armoured home-designed Land Ships and Medium Tanks with a strong emphasis on defence. The Protectorate traditionally employs French-built equipment, but the Royalists have gained arms from the Kingdom of Britannia to bolster their forces.


=== Prussian Scandinavia ===
Prussian Scandinavia is a Dominion of the Prussian Empire and home of the powerful Teutonic Order, closely linked with the Prussian Imperial family for generations.
Any Teutonic Order fleet has access to all of the equipment available to their Prussian brothers and far to the north in Prussian Scandinavia, the forces of the Teutonic Order are mobilising their full armed strength in their old domains, with huge war engines and elite soldiers massing to take their place in the Prussian Empire front lines.


=== Other Alliance Nations ===
There are also a variety of other Alliance Nations in the Dystopian Wars universe. The following Alliance Nations are yet to be released: United Kingdom of Romania, Free Hellenic Kingdom, Belgian Royalist Rebels, Alliance Preference: Grand Coalition, Portuguese Empire, League of Italian States, Ottoman Dominions, Republic of Egypt, Spanish Republican Confederacy (SRC), Socialist Union of South America (SUSA), Free Republic of Chile, Chinese Federation, Commonwealth of Free Australia.


== Reception ==
Dystopian Wars has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The game currently holds an average rating of 7.78/10 with BoardGameGeek, based on 125 ratings. Peter Ray Allison of OneMetal describes the game as ""an excellent miniatures game that has many gamers claiming Dystopian Wars as the game that got them back into gaming."" Allison also describes the rules system as ""refreshing"", referring to its accommodation of land, sea or air engagements.
Phil Spurgeon of The Shell Case describes Dystopian Wars as ""an excellent game with great ambition and superb models."" Spurgeon praises the quality of the background material and the rules, but feels that the rulebook could be read better and is in need of improvement.
Raef Granger and Russ Wakelin of the D6 Generation gave Dystopian Wars a 2++ rating (97%), describing the game as very cinematic and praising the look of the models. Raef picks out the Prussian Empire Imperium Class Sky Fortress as the most iconic model in Dystopian Wars. Craig Gallant of the D6 Generation gave Dystopian Wars a 3++ rating (89%), praising the games cinematics but criticising some of the editing in the rulebook. Overall, the D6 Generation team felt that Dystopian Wars mixes exciting elements of naval gameplay, steampunk and alternative reality to offer a unique gaming experience.

They are presented by the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design at the Origins Game Fair on an annual basis for the previous year; for example, the 1979 awards were given at the 1980 Origins. Categories for the Origins award can vary from year to year, and there is not a ""Game of the Year"" per se.
The Origins Award is commonly referred to as a Calliope, as the statuette is in the likeness of the muse of the same name. Academy members frequently shorten this name to ""Callie"".


=== Premio JdA ===
This award is for Game of the Year in Spain, ""Premio al Juego de mesa del año"" (Premio JdA), by an independent jury of game industry representatives.


=== Spiel des Jahres ===
These games are winners of the Spiel des Jahres, a German board game award widely considered the most prestigious in the industry.


==== Kennerspiel des Jahres ====
These are winners of Kennerspiel des Jahres, an expansion of the German Spiel des Jahres board game award starting in 2011. It translates to ""connoisseur/expert game of the year"" and is meant for more experienced gamers.


==== Kinderspiel des Jahres ====
The Kinderspiel des Jahres is awarded annually to the best children's game by a jury of German game critics. This award is to children's games what the Spiel des Jahres is to family games.
2001 was the first year that the Kinderspiel des Jahres was officially awarded. Prior to that year, it was a subcategory of the Spiel des Jahres awards known as the Sonderpreis ""Kinderspiel"" (""Special Prize for Best Children's Game""). Since the intent behind both awards is the same, it is customary to refer to the 1989–2000 Sonderpreis winners as having won the Kinderspiel des Jahres.

Eldritch Horror,An unknown Elder God approaches the world—and you must solve mysteries to stop it.,2013,1,8,4,120,240,14,3.32,Thematic,,"Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure board game designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by Chaosium. The game is based on Chaosium's roleplaying game Call of Cthulhu, which is set in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other horror writers. The game's second edition was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005, with a third edition in 2018.


== Overview ==
The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional Massachusetts town of Arkham in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other planes open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.)  Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as ""sanity""), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates.
After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate.  While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them.  As gates open, a ""Doom Track"" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham.  In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose.  In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise, they lose.


== History ==
Arkham Horror was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game, a new strategic game based on their Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. It was edited in-house by Chaosium, who added such features as the Doom Track, a method to track progress toward the total failure of the players, and was published in 1987 as Arkham Horror.  The game won the ""Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1987"" award in the Origins Awards, becoming the first Lovecraft themed board game to achieve significant popularity.
Arkham Horror was one of several Lovecraft-based board games submitted by Launius, with other designs from the same period including 'The Trail of the Brotherhood', 'DreamQuests', and 'Imprisoned with the Pharaohs'. Arkham Horror was the only of these games to see professional publication.
The original printing of Arkham Horror sold out. Chaosium announced reprints several times, but they never occurred, and Chaosium discontinued production of the game in 1991.
In 2004 online game company Skotos acquired the rights to Arkham Horror from Richard Launius, and later arranged publication with Fantasy Flight Games. The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, Kevin Wilson at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a roll-and-move system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay.  The 2005 edition shares art and other elements with Fantasy Flight Games' other Cthulhu Mythos-based game: Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game.
The new edition was released in July 2005 and sold out, with a second reprinting also being released in 2005.
In early 2011, Fantasy Flight released Elder Sign, a game based on Arkham Horror but which provides a much faster-paced alternative. By streamlining many of Arkham Horror's mechanics and using dice to solve encounters, games of Elder Sign lasts 90 minutes on average, rather than 2–4 hours.
In 2016 at Arkham Nights, a celebration of Cthulhu games by Fantasy Flight Games, the original designer Richard Launius returned to host a special event using a modified version of the original game.  Multiple games were held over the course of the weekend.
In November 2019, Aconyte Books announced a-tie in novels based on the world of Arkham Horror, titled Arkham Horror: Wrath of N’Kai. The novel is set to be published in May 2020.
A video game adaptation, Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace, was released in March 2021.


== 1987 edition ==

The 1987 version of Arkham Horror has the following game components: a board map of the town of Arkham; 99 playing cards with various events; 50 monster counters; two 4-page investigator rules sheets; eight investigator cards; eight pawns; and markers.  The cards and tokens are illustrated with black-and-white drawings and silhouettes. The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces.
There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location.
Investigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength.
The turns of the investigators are preceded by the ""Mythos Phase"", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one.
For each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the ""Doom of Arkham"" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose.
Victory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one.


=== Reception ===
In the April 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue 168), Ken Rolston called the game his ""first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect."" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, ""If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.""

=== Gameplay ===

Each player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to ""slide"" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, Lore and Luck is one pair - if the player maximizes their character's Lore, they simultaneously minimize their Luck.
Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of Sanity and Stamina. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. hit points). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of roleplaying to the game.
Each player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.
The basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).
Characters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when the player spends a Clue token on that particular type of roll.
Each turn, the players move their characters on the board, fight or evade monsters and have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location). They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.
Characters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.
At the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters.
If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.
Certain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an Elder Sign item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.
If the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.


=== Expansions ===
Arkham Horror has received a total of eight expansions:

Curse of the Dark Pharaoh, released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011. This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on Nyarlathotep, one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.
Dunwich Horror, released during Gen Con 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story The Dunwich Horror, it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, new Great Old Ones, and new mechanics for defeated characters: a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores them to their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues; and when they lose their last point of Stamina, they may take a similar Injury card. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.
The King in Yellow, confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like Curse of the Dark Pharaoh, it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the Robert W. Chambers story The King in Yellow, this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald — a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does, unless the player takes a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the Fantasy Flight Games website as a Herald for the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the Dunwich Horror expansion.
Kingsport Horror, released in June 2008. It is similar to Dunwich Horror in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other ""aquatic"" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.
Black Goat of the Woods, released at Gen Con in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow the player to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.
Innsmouth Horror, announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009. The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.
The Lurker at the Threshold, announced in February 2010 and released in July 2010. This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. Also introduced were Relationships, which are cards describing how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit, and a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself.
Miskatonic Horror, announced in February 2011 and released in July 2011. The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Other World, and Mythos cards. Rather than building on the content of the base game, this expansion builds on the content of the other expansions, adding more features that can be used the more other expansions are included. New player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant were included as well.


=== Reception ===
Ben Kuchera reviewed the game for Ars Technica, and noted that in a game with 700 tokens ""brevity is not one of its strengths ... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased."" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, ""it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.""


== 2018 edition ==
A third edition of Arkham Horror was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018. This version incorporates design elements from Eldritch Horror and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. An expansion, Dead of Night, was released on October 8, 2019. A second expansion, Under Dark Waves, re-exploring Innsmouth and Kingsport, was released on September 18, 2020. On June 11, 2021, a third expansion titled Secrets of the Order was released, this time taking players to the French Hill neighborhood and the underworld.


== Novels ==
In 2011 a series of novels were published under the Arkham Horror banner via Fantasy Flight Games, beginning with Ghouls of the Miskatonic by Graham McNeill. A new series, beginning with Wrath of N'kai by Joshua Reynolds, began publication in 2020 through Aconyte.

The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth,"Heroes explore Middle-earth, working together to combat evil in an epic campaign.",2019,1,5,2,60,120,14,2.59,Thematic,,"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a non-collectible customizable card game produced by Fantasy Flight Games. As part of the Living Card Game (LCG) genre, it is a cooperative and strategic card game set in Middle-earth, a fantasy world featured in literary works by J. R. R. Tolkien, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Its digital adaptation, titled The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game, is published by Asmodee Digital for cross-platform play on Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, being the ""first ever digital LCG"".


== Mechanics ==
Like other card games in Fantasy Flight's ""Living Card Game"" line, it has deck construction and regularly released expansions similar to a collectible card game, but without the randomized card distribution.
The game may be played either solitaire or with a group. Up to 2 players can play the game with a single core set, and up to 4 players can play with an additional core set. Unlike most card games of this type, this game is a cooperative game; the players are not opponents, but work together against an ""encounter deck"" which represents the forces of Sauron and produces the obstacles that the players have to conquer.
Each player has their own cards: their heroes (up to 3) which start in play, and a deck of at least 50 cards, composed of Allies, Attachments (such as weapons, armor, and other items), and Events. Although the core set comes with pre-constructed decks, deck construction is a major aspect of the game, and many players build their own decks, utilising cards from the various expansions.


== Community ==
The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game has an active following, with multiple podcasts and blogs dedicated to discussing gameplay, strategy, deck-building, and news, as well as providing custom content. Podcasts include Cardboard of the Rings, The Grey Company, and The Mouth of Sauron. Blogs include Tales From the Cards, Hall of Beorn, Master of Lore, Dor Cuarthol, and Vision of the Palantir.


== Expansions ==
There are several types of expansion to this game. Each Deluxe Expansion (and the core set) contain 3 quests and begins a new cycle, which usually shares a mechanical or story-driven theme. These releases are supplemented by 6 Adventure Packs for a total of 9 quests per cycle. The Hero and Campaign Expansions combine a cycle's Deluxe Expansion and its related Adventure packs (i.e. The Lost Realm expansion and the six Angmar Awakened packs) into two products, while also adding campaign cards. The Saga Expansions follow the story of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, with the initial time-frame for the game the 17 years between Bilbo leaving The Shire and Frodo following him. The latter introduced a mode of play called Campaign mode allowing for some degree of permanence between the quests telling the story. Players can earn powerful ""Boon"" cards, which can be used in the following quests, as well as ""Burden"" cards which make future quests more difficult.
The Standalone Scenarios are one-off quests released without any playing cards. Fantasy Flight Games usually releases one to coincide with their Gen Con event and their Fellowship (in the house) event. They have often been more difficult than a standard quest and allow the designers to experiment with ideas outside the confines of the main game.

Adventure Pack Cycles continue the story of Deluxe Expansions, or, in the case of the Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle, the Base Game. Each Deluxe expansion provides encounter cards for three scenarios, and each Adventure Pack in the associated Cycle provides encounter cards for one more scenario. Both types of expansions also introduce new player cards. An Adventure pack consists of 60 fixed cards.


== Adventure Card Game ==
In October 2017, Asmodee Digital and Fantasy Flight announced the formation of Fantasy Flight Interactive, a division of the merged companies to bring more of Fantasy Flight's physical board games to digital implementations. Among the games, developed by the studio was The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game. Fantasy Flight Interactive released it on 28 August 2018 with the title The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game in an early access phase. It was fully released on 29 August 2019 on PC and Mac (Steam), and by the end of the year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch (developed by Virtuos) with cross-platform play. In December 2019 (Steam) and early 2020 (other platforms) it was upgraded under the title The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game - Definitive Edition which includes all additional content as well as a new mode. However, as part of company-wide layoffs, the Fantasy Flight Interactive division was closed down in January 2020. Following the closure of Fantasy Flight Interactive, by February 2020, Asmodee announced that it was opening up its library of board games to be made into digital versions through licensing options to any developer. Since mid-2020, the game's developing was continued by Antihero Studios, who made a major update in October 2020 introducing offline play mode and new Adventure mode with free pack ""The Fords of Isen"" among others.
The game is not a direct adaptation but heavily inspired by the original card game. It has campaign stories, adventures, and quests that are narrated and with different paths, characters who are voiced, and dynamic reactions by the artificial intelligence of Sauron (and Saruman) in three difficulty levels (standard, advanced, and expert). It is based on player versus environment experience (PvE) intended for a solo player and online co-op. Decks are composed of 3 heroes and 30 common cards out of many heroes and different card types (allies, attachments, and events), with all the cards divided into four categories (purple ""leadership"", green ""lore"", blue ""spirit"", and red ""tactics""), which the player can combine in deck building making various decks besides the pre-built decks with different styles of play. The cards have a cost value to play, with characters having an attack, health, and willpower number, with the latter used for completing objectives or raising the player's meter to activate bonus abilities. Sauron also has his own cards and ""threat"" meter which uses to activate bonus events and when full makes an automatic defeat of the player. Each round, the player and the enemy take turns playing a single action until all playable options are exhausted.


== Reception ==
Both versions were released to positive reception. The 2018 Zatu Games review gave a score of 85 out of 100 to the tabletop version, praising the quality of the thematic content, artwork, game structure, challenges that are replayable by different approaches, and player interaction, making it especially attractive to those wanting to explore the world of Middle-earth. However both with review by HCL, noted it's needed to keep in mind it has a demanding learning curve to successfully beat the game and the number of expansions. It received several nominations at the Golden Geek Awards for the best card game, thematic board game, board game artwork/presentation, and 2-player board game category.
The digital version on review aggregator website Metacritic has a score of 70-75 out of 100 based on few reviews published before the release of the definitive edition in December 2019. Although still not as expansive in content as the tabletop version, they praised that the game is bringing a new PvE and cooperative gameplay to the digital collectible card game industry, the art, story-telling, voice acting, and game mechanic which cards are a bit simplified in comparison to tabletop due to the format, having resemblance to Hearthstone, but none the less complexity and strategy to tabletop. Chris Carter writing for Destructoid found it ""one of the most enjoyable games I've ever experienced, tabletop or otherwise"" and concluded that the way Living Card Game (LCG) genre is created and developed through the game ""could be a guiding light in an increasingly predatory industry. With loot box legislation around the corner ... it may launch at a perfect time"".

Rising Sun,"Lead your clan to victory through negotiation, combat, monsters and favors from Kami.",2018,3,5,"4, 5",90,120,14,3.28,Strategy,,"Diplomacy is a strategic board game created by Allan B. Calhamer in 1954 and released commercially in the United States in 1959. Its main distinctions from most board wargames are its negotiation phases (players spend much of their time forming and betraying alliances with other players and forming beneficial strategies) and the absence of dice and other game elements that produce random effects. Set in Europe in the years leading to the First World War, Diplomacy is played by two to seven players, each controlling the armed forces of a major European power (or, with fewer players, multiple powers). Each player aims to move their few starting units and defeat those of others to win possession of a majority of strategic cities and provinces marked as ""supply centers"" on the map; these supply centers allow players who control them to produce more units. Following each round of player negotiations, each player can issue attack and support orders, which are then executed during the movement phase. A player takes control of a province when the number of provinces that are given orders to support the attacking province exceeds the number of provinces given orders to support the defending province.
Diplomacy was the first commercially published game to be played by mail (PBM); only chess, which is in the public domain, saw significant postal play earlier. Diplomacy was also the first commercially published game to generate an active hobby scene with amateur fanzines; only science-fiction, fantasy and comics fandom saw fanzines earlier. Competitive face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments have been held since the 1970s. Play of Diplomacy by e-mail (PBEM) has been widespread since the late 1980s.
Diplomacy has been published in the United States by Games Research, Avalon Hill, and Hasbro; the name is currently a registered trademark of Hasbro's Avalon Hill division. Diplomacy has also been licensed to various companies for publication in other countries. Diplomacy is also played on the Internet, adjudicated by a computer or a human gamemaster.


== History ==
The idea for Diplomacy arose from Allan B. Calhamer's study at Harvard of nineteenth-century European history under Sidney B. Fay and from his study of political geography. Calhamer also drew inspiration from the card game of Hearts, in which he observed that players were at an advantage when they teamed up against the leader, and from the game of chess, which inspired him to use a limited number of spaces and pieces.
The rough form of Diplomacy was created in 1954, and its details were developed through playtesting until the 1958 map and rules revisions. Calhamer paid for a 500-game print run of that version in 1959 after rejection by major companies. It has been published since then by Games Research (in 1961, then a 1971 edition with a revised rulebook), Avalon Hill (in 1976), by Hasbro's Avalon Hill division (in 1999), and now by Wizards of the Coast (in 2008) in the US, and licensed to other boardgame publishers for versions sold in other countries. Among these are Parker Brothers, Waddingtons Games, Gibsons Games, and Asmodée Editions.
The first copy of the first print run was sold by the Calhamer estate through auction in 2017. 


== Basic setting and overview ==
The board is a map of 1901 Europe plus Turkey, Syria and North Africa. It is divided into fifty-six land regions and nineteen sea regions. Forty-two of the land regions are divided among the seven Great Powers of the game: Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.  The remaining fourteen land regions are neutral at the start of the game.
Thirty-four of the land regions contain ""supply centers"", corresponding to major centers of government, industry or commerce (e.g., Vienna and Rome); twenty-two of these are located within the Great Powers and are referred to as ""home"" supply centers. The remaining twelve are located in the neutral provinces. The number of supply centers a player controls determines the total number of armies and fleets a player may have on the board, and as players gain and lose control of centers, they may build (raise) or must remove (disband) units correspondingly.

The land provinces within the Great Powers which contain supply centers are generally named after a major city in the province (e.g. London and Moscow) while the other land provinces within the Great Powers are generally named after a region (e.g. Bohemia and Apulia). Neutral land provinces are generally named after countries (e.g. Serbia and Belgium).
All players other than Britain and Russia begin the game with two armies and one fleet; Britain starts with two fleets and one army, and Russia starts with two armies and two fleets, making it the only player to start the game with more than three units. Only one unit at a time may occupy a given map region. Balancing units to supply center counts is done after each game-year, which involves two seasons of play: Spring and Fall.
At the beginning of the game, the twelve neutral supply centers are typically captured within the first few moves. Further acquisition of supply centers becomes a zero sum dynamic with any gains in a player's resources coming at the expense of a rival.


== Historicity ==
Although the game starts in 1901, the map generally reflects the political boundaries of Europe in 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War. Bosnia is already annexed to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Balkans reflect the results of the wars of 1912 and 1913 in the region.
On the other hand, Montenegro is shown as part of Austria-Hungary. Additionally, North Africa and Tunis start the game as neutral, despite these regions being part of the French colonial empire in 1914. Finland and Syria are both parts of Great Powers, as Finland was part of the Russian Empire, and Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire in 1914. Tunis is used rather than Tunisia on most boards. North Africa is a single province covering parts of Algeria and Morocco.


== Comparison with other war games ==
Diplomacy differs from the majority of war games because:

Players do not take turns sequentially; instead all players secretly write down their moves after a negotiation period, then all moves are revealed and put into effect simultaneously.
Social interaction and interpersonal skills make up an essential part of the play.
The rules that simulate combat are strategic, abstract, and simple—not tactical, realistic, or complex—as this is a diplomatic simulation game, not a military one.
Combat resolution contains no random elements—no dice are rolled or cards drawn.
Each military unit has the same strength.
It is especially well suited to postal play, which led to an active hobby of amateur publishing.
Internet Diplomacy is one of the few early board games that is still played on the web.
The game board is on the scale of an entire continent, rather than a single campaign theater.
Land and sea power are almost equally significant, and a player's decision as to whether to raise an army or a fleet is highly significant.


== Gameplay ==
Diplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the ""Spring"" and ""Fall"" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by ""retreat"" or ""disband"" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.


=== Negotiation phase ===
In the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.
Communication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.


=== Movement phase ===
After the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a ""convoy"". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).
Certain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.


=== End-of-year and supply centers ===
After each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw – around half of all games will end in a draw.


== Variants ==
Several boardgames based on Diplomacy have been commercially published. Additionally, many fans of the game have created hundreds of variants of their own, using altered rules on the standard map, standard rules on a different map, or both.


=== Rulebook provision for fewer than seven players ===
The rules allow for games with two to six players, closing parts of the standard board, but these are used only in casual play, and are not considered standard Diplomacy in tournament, postal, or most forms of online play. For example, if there are six players, everyone plays one country and Italy is not used; for five players, Italy and Germany are not used. The original rules did not include additional guidelines, but the Avalon Hill set included suggestions, such as individual players using multiple countries, and additions.
Another approach to solving the problem of fewer than seven players is the use of the Escalation Variant Rules by Edi Birsan:

Players start with no pieces on the board
Players put one piece down on the board in any province one at a time (starting with the youngest player)
After reaching the maximum number of pieces the players start the game with ownership of their starting provinces.
At the end of Fall 1901 with their adjustments players write down their three HOME centers for the rest of the game.
This is done without negotiations and may result in two players declaring the same province. However, in order to build there they still must own it and the province must be open. Players may choose any supply center as a HOME for example: EDI, DEN, ROM
It is suggested that for the number players the following starting pieces are used:

Two – 12 units
Three – 8 units
Four − 6 units
Five – 5 units
Six – 4 units
It is also suggested that for games with 2–4 players that the 'Gunboat' rule applies which means that there are no discussions.
For 4 or 5 players, it is suggested that the 'Wilson' or 'Public Press' rule applies which means that all discussions must take place in the open at the table with no whispers or secret signals.
For 5 or 6 players, it is suggested that regular negotiation rules apply.
The following are the current official suggestions:


==== Alternative way to play ====
The following is an alternative way to play the game of Diplomacy when fewer than seven players are present.

Six Players
Eliminate Italy. Italian units hold in position and defend themselves, but don't support each other. Units belonging to any of the players can support them in their holding position. If Italian units are forced to retreat, they're disbanded.
Five Players
Eliminate Italy and Germany (as described for Italy above).
Four Players
One player plays Britain, and the other three play the following pairs: Austria/France, Germany/Turkey, and Italy/Russia.
Three Players
One player controls Britain/Germany/Austria; the second, Russia/Italy; and the third, France/Turkey. Or one player plays Britain/Austria; one plays France/Russia; one plays Germany/Turkey. In this version Italy is not played.
Three Players (alternative)
One person plays Russia while the other two control Britain/France/Germany and Austria/Italy/Turkey.
Two Players
This version can be played as a World War I simulation. One player controls Britain/France/Russia while the other plays Austria/Germany/Turkey. Italy is neutral and Italian territory can't be entered. The game begins in 1914. Before the Fall 1914 adjustments, flip a coin. Italy joins the winner of the toss in Spring 1915. The first player to control 24 supply centers wins. This is also a way for two new players to learn the rules.
In games for two, three, or four players, supply-center ownership is computed for each individual country, even though the same person plays more than one country. As with the regular rules, adjustments must be made by each country in accordance with its supply-center holdings.


=== Commercially published Diplomacy variants ===
There have been six commercially released variants of Diplomacy — Machiavelli, Kamakura, Colonial Diplomacy, Hundred, Ard-Rí and Classical. Imperial is a boardgame with enough similarities to be described as a Diplomacy variant by some.


==== Machiavelli ====

Machiavelli was published by Battleline Publications, later taken over by Avalon Hill. Set in Renaissance Italy, the board is controlled by the Republic of Florence, the Republic of Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, the Papacy, Valois France, Habsburg Austria, and the Ottoman Turks. The game introduces many rules changes such as money, bribery, three seasons per year, garrisons, and random events such as plague and famine. It features scenarios tailored for as few as four and as many as eight players.


==== Kamakura ====
Kamakura was published by West End Games in the early 1980s. Its setting is feudal Japan.


==== Colonial Diplomacy ====
Published by Avalon Hill in 1994. It is set in Asia in the late 19th century, and much of the board is controlled by various colonial powers: the United Kingdom, the Russian Empire, the Empire of Japan, Holland, Ottoman Empire, China, and France. The game introduces three special features:

The Trans-Siberian railroad extends across Russia from Moscow to Vladivostok. The railroad can be used by Russia to move armies anywhere along the railroad. The TSR may only be used by Russia. Russian armies are allowed to move through other Russian armies, but foreign armies can block the passage of armies on the TSR.
The Suez Canal is the only way to move between the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea. Use of the Suez Canal is controlled by whoever is in control of  Egypt. The use of the Suez Canal increases in importance later in the game as expansion becomes both more important and more difficult.
The ownership of Hong Kong counts as a supply center for any country except China.
This map was used as the basis of the Imperial Asia expansion map.
Colonial Diplomacy won in a tie the Origins Award for Best Pre-20th Century Board Game of 1995.


==== Hundred ====
Hundred is a map for three players by Andy D. Schwarz based on the Hundred Years' War created in 1996 and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Ard-Rí ====
Ard-Rí is a map by Stuart John Bernard based on pre-Christian Ireland (though it anachronistically includes Vikings), created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000. Ard-Rí happens to also be the name of a hnefatafl variant played in Ancient Ireland.


==== Classical ====
Classical is a map by Andy D. Schwarz and Vincent Mous based on the ancient world after the death of Alexander the Great, created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Diplomacy of the Three Kingdoms ====
Based on the Three Kingdoms in Ancient China, it was created by Edi Birsan to introduce the basic ideas of the main game to a Chinese audience with a setting more close to their own historical experience. It was published by MJS Creations in 2008.


=== Diplomacy variants not commercially published ===
A wide range of other variants of Diplomacy have been created and played without being commercially published. These include settings such as the ancient and renaissance world. Some variants use new maps and rules, while others simply vary the original game, such as the Fleet Rome variant which replaces the starting Italian army in Rome with a fleet.


==== Youngstown ====
One of the most notable non-commercially published is the Youngstown variant which is an extension of the normal map, including Asia and colonies there. For example, in addition to the usual home centers, France starts with a fleet in Saigon (in Cochinchina). Three new Powers were added – India, China, and Japan - with powers without historical Asian colonies being given more home centers. The variant was named after the city of Youngstown, Ohio where the variant was invented.


== Tournaments ==

Diplomacy is played at a number of formal tournaments in many nations. Most face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments longer than one day are associated with either a Diplomacy-centered convention (such as DipCon or Dixiecon) or a large multi-game convention (such as the Origins Game Fair or the World Boardgaming Championships). Some conventions are centered on the games and have a highly competitive atmosphere; others have more focus on meeting and socializing with other players from the postal or e-mail parts of the hobby.


=== Tournament play ===
In some tournaments, each game ends after a specified number of game-years, to ensure that all players can play in all rounds without limiting the tournament structure to one round per day. At other events, a game continues until a winner is determined or a draw is voted. Tournaments in Europe are generally played with a specific end year whereas tournaments in North America more often are played until someone wins or a draw is agreed.


=== Major championship tournaments ===
The World Diplomacy Convention (WDC or World DipCon) is held annually in different places in the world. The winner of WDC is considered to be the World Champion of Diplomacy. WDC was first held in 1988 in Birmingham, England, and was held at two-year intervals before becoming an annual event. WDC's site moves among four regions: North America, Europe, Australasia, and the rest of the world, with a requirement that successive WDC's are always held in different regions.
The North American Diplomacy Convention (DipCon) is held annually in different places in North America, to determine the North American Champion of Diplomacy. DipCon was first held in 1966 in Youngstown, Ohio. DipCon's site rotates among West, Central, and East regions.
The European Diplomacy Convention (Euro DipCon) is held annually in different places in Europe, to determine the European Champion of Diplomacy.
Over a dozen other countries hold face-to-face national championship tournaments.


=== Other major face-to-face tournaments ===
Many of the larger multi-game conventions, such as the World Boardgaming Championships, Gen Con, Origins, ManorCon, TempleCon, and Dragonflight also host Diplomacy tournaments. On occasion, WDC or DipCon will be held in conjunction with one of these conventions.
In addition, many of the larger local and regional clubs host tournaments on an annual basis and always encourage visitors from the local area as well as any travelers from around the globe.


=== Major play-by-email tournaments ===
The play-by-email field is constantly changing. There are numerous tournaments generally associated with different websites. As of 2008 there were no official events sanctioned by the manufacturer (Wizards/Avalon Hill). There have been and continue to be events with various sizes and self designated titles such as:

World Masters – every two years in the Worldmasters E-mail Tournament composed of both team and individual events
Diplomacy World Cup – modeled after a Soccer World Cup (players are in teams competing by countries), there have been two world cups so far and a third is under way. The first took place 2007-9 and was won by France, the second 2010-12 and was won by Ireland, and the third version started in January 2013.
Winter Blitz – The 4th Annual Winter Blitz became open to join in 2011.


== Other ways to play ==

Despite the length of face-to-face Diplomacy games, there are people who organize and host games, and there are also various clubs that have annual tournaments and monthly club games.
To overcome the difficulty of assembling enough players for a sufficiently large block of time together, a play-by-mail game community has developed, either via Postal or Internet Diplomacy, using either humans to adjudicate the turns or automatic adjudicators. The current largest example of a dedicated online Diplomacy server with automatic adjudicators is Backstabbr.com, developed by Tile Games.


=== Postal and email play ===

Since the 1960s, Diplomacy has been played by mail through fanzines. The play-by-mail (PBM) hobby was created in 1963 by Dr. John Boardman of New York City. He did so in carbon-copied typed flyers, recruiting players through his science fiction fanzine Knowable. His flyers became an ongoing publication under the Graustark title, and led directly to the formation of other zines. Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax was also a Diplomacy PBM player in the 1960s.
By May 1965 there were eight Diplomacy zines. By the end of 1967 there were dozens of zines in the US, and by 1970 their editors were holding gatherings. In 1969, Don Turnbull started the first UK-based Diplomacy zine, Albion. These were ""affectionately"" known as ""Dippy zines"". Prior to the 1980s, most had circulations of about 50 subscribers, but some had hundreds.
By 1972, both the US and UK hobbies were forming organizations. In the 1980s, there were over sixty zines, such as Diplomacy World and the like, in the main list of the North American Zine Poll, peaking at 72 zines in 1989; and there were nearly as many in the major Zine Poll of the British part of the hobby.

Competition was fierce, leading some Diplomacy PBM players to ""go to great lengths to win"". In the UK, this included, in a few cases, bribery, blackmail, and even forging mail from other players or the Gamemaster, as well as mail interference (for example altering a letter to ensure a missed deadline was marked in time by a forged postmark). According to reviewer Martin Croft, in the early 1980s, Two players managed to get into trouble with the police ... [while] involved in complex negotiations about an attack on the gamer playing Britain. To avoid postal delays, one sent the other a telegram which read ATTACK ON LIVERPOOL CONFIRMED. Both spent some time explaining to the police that it was only a game.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the number of postal Diplomacy zines has reduced as new players instead joined the part of the hobby that plays over the internet via e-mail or on websites. In April 2010, Graustark itself ceased publication.  As of 2011, there are only a few active postal zines published in the US, one each in Canada and Australia, and several in the UK and elsewhere. In order to reduce postage and printing costs, as well as for environmental reasons, several zines (e.g. Western Front, Maniacs Paradise) are distributed to subscribers via emailed links to the zine's web page when a new issue appears, or are emailed out as PDF files, for subscribers to read on screen or print out as they choose. Some zines maintain a dual existence as paper and digital publications.
The first known electronic Diplomacy zine was Mad As Hell, distributed on Usenet in 1982. Diplomacy has been played through e-mail on the Internet since the 1983 debut of The Armchair Diplomat on Compuserve.  The GEnie online service offered fully automated versions of Diplomacy and variants to subscribers.


=== Diplomacy computer games ===

Avalon Hill released a computer game version of Diplomacy in 1984 for the IBM PC. Computer Gaming World in 1987 stated that its computer opponents ""simply stay the appetite of zealous Diplomacy players until they can gather flesh and blood victims"". The magazine in 1994 described it as ""a flop"".
Hasbro Interactive released a computer game version of Diplomacy (called Avalon Hill's Diplomacy) in 1999 under the MicroProse label, and developed by Meyer/Glass Interactive. A major fault, like with the Avalon Hill version, was that the computer AI was considered poor, one reviewer remarking ""Gamers of any skill level will have no trouble whatsoever whaling on the computer at even the highest difficulty setting.""
Paradox Interactive released a new computer version in 2005, which was given negative reviews, partly due to the odd grunts the game used to express the reactions of the AI players during the Movement phase. None of the computer games supported either text or voice chat, which limited the possibilities for complicated alliances.  In 2011, artificial intelligence scholars noted that work on Diplomacy-focused AI has been carried out since mid-1980s, but so far this endeavour met ""little success"".
The first artificial-intelligence Diplomacy conquest was organized in 2015 as part of the International Computer Game Association.
The first place in the contest was won by Dave de Jonge. 
In November 2022, Meta Platforms announced that they had developed an AI to play Diplomacy online at a competitive level, ranking in the top 10% of players.


== Reception ==
In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nick Palmer thought that despite ""primitive"" movement and combat rules, ""the game has an extraordinary charm all its own, based on the fascinating interplay of alliances between the seven players"". He concluded, ""This can be strongly recommended to anyone interested in games of multi-player negotiation"".
In the 1980 book The Complete Book of Wargames, game designer Jon Freeman called this game ""Probably the most famous wargame in existence ... The double-dealing required attracts some people irresistibly and repels others just as strongly, but the interaction in Diplomacy is the model for all other 'power politics' games."" Freeman only had two issues with the game: ""the number of players required and the time it takes to play."" Freeman gave the game an overall evaluation of ""Excellent"", concluding, ""This is a classic game in every sense of the word.""
Diplomacy was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Game designer Larry Harris explained: ""I am convinced that Allan Calhamer's masterpiece should be part of every high school curriculum. Don't tell the kids, but it teaches history, geography, the art of political negotiation, and something else – some healthy critical skepticism. By the time you get into high school, you have a pretty good idea that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!""
In its catalog, Avalon Hill advertised Diplomacy as the favorite game of John F. Kennedy. Gyles Brandreth, in the UK magazine Games & Puzzles   claimed Diplomacy was Henry Kissinger's favorite game. American broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite is reported to have been a fan of the game. Michael Portillo, British journalist, broadcaster, and former Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, is known to have played the game while studying at Harrow County School for Boys.
Diplomacy was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Adventure Hall of Fame in 1994.

Diplomacy   at BoardGameGeek"
Patchwork,Piece together a quilt and leave no holes to become the button master.,2014,2,2,2,15,30,8,1.62,Abstract,  Family,"A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game, (generally just referred to as board games in Europe) is a class of tabletop games that generally has indirect player interaction and multiple ways to score points. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit.


== History ==

Due in part to postwar aversion to products which glorified conflict, the 3M series of strategy and economic games, including Acquire, became popular in Germany and provided a template for a new form of gameplay without direct conflict or warfare. 


=== German family board games ===
The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany. The genre has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Settlers of Catan, first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe.
Though neither the first Eurogame nor the first such game to find an audience outside Germany, it became much more popular than any of its predecessors. It quickly sold millions of copies in Germany, and in the process brought money and attention to the genre as a whole.


=== 21st century ===
Germany purchased more board games per capita than any other country as of 2009. While many Eurogames are published and played in Anglophone markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, and Alhambra.


== Characteristics ==

Eurogames tend to be focused on challenge for players. They feature economics and the acquisition of resources rather than direct conflict, and have a limited amount of luck. They also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict. Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the wargames that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as SPI and Avalon Hill, but nonetheless often have a considerable depth of play.
One consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as Puerto Rico that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like Terra Mystica and Tzolkin being significantly more difficult to master.


=== Incentive for social play ===

While many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, Eurogames are, for the most part, well-suited to social play. In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. In contrast to games such as Risk or Monopoly, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a pre-determined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources.  Playing time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. Generally Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge; although there is a sizeable body of German-style games that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate anywhere from two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare, with Power Grid and Caverna (the latter supporting seven player games) being two examples, or require expansions, as with The Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne. Players usually play for themselves individually, rather than in a partnership or team.
A growing number of Eurogames support solo play with modified rulesets. To win, the player either has to achieve specific single-player campaign goals or beat the score of a simulated opponent that takes actions according to special rules outlined in the scenario. Recent Eurogames suitable for solo play include Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island.


=== No player elimination ===
Another prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination.  Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games.  Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game. Related to no-player-elimination, Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead. A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing. Balancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders. This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end, an example of which is Power Grid, where the turn order is determined by number of cities (and biggest power plant as the tie-breaker), such that players further ahead are handicapped in their option of plays.


=== Game mechanics ===
A wide variety of often innovative mechanisms or mechanics are used, and familiar mechanics such as rolling dice and moving, capture, or trick taking are avoided. If a game has a board, the board is usually irregular rather than uniform or symmetric (such as Risk rather than chess or Scrabble). The board is often random (as in The Settlers of Catan) or has random elements (such as Tikal). Some boards are merely mnemonic or organizational and contribute only to ease of play, such as a cribbage board; examples of this include Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence. Random elements are often present but do not usually dominate the game. While rules are light to moderate, they allow depth of play, usually requiring thought, planning, and a shift of tactics through the game and featuring a chess- or backgammon-like opening game, middle game, and end game.
Stewart Woods' Eurogames cites six examples of mechanics common to eurogames:

Tile Placement – spatial placement of game components on the playing board.
Auctions – includes open and hidden auctions of both resources and actions from other players and the game system itself.
Trading/Negotiation – not simply trading resources of equivalent values, but allowing players to set markets.
Set Collection – collecting resources in specific groups that are then cashed in for points or other currency.
Area Control – also known as area majority or influence, this involves controlling a game element or board space through allocation of resources.
Worker Placement or Role Selection – players choose specific game actions in sequential order, with players disallowed from choosing a previously selected action.


=== Low randomness ===

Eurogame designs tend to de-emphasize luck and random elements. Often, the only random element of the game will be resource or terrain distribution in the initial setup, or (less frequently) the random order of a set of event or objective cards. The role played by deliberately random mechanics in other styles of game is instead fulfilled by the unpredictability of the behavior of other players.


=== Themes ===
Examples of themes are:

Carcassonne – build a medieval landscape complete with walled cities, monasteries, roads, and fields.
Puerto Rico – develop plantations on the island of Puerto Rico, set in the 18th century.
Power Grid – expand a power company's network and buy better plants.
Imperial – as an international investor, influence the politics of pre-World War I European empires.
Bruxelles 1893 – take the role of an Art Nouveau architect during the late 19th century and try to become the most famous architect in Belgium.


=== Game designer as author ===
Although not relevant to actual play, the name of the game's designer is often prominently mentioned on the box, or at least in the rule book. Top designers enjoy considerable following among enthusiasts of Eurogames. For this reason, the name ""designer games"" is often offered as a description of the genre. Recently, there has also been a wave of games designed as spin-offs of popular novels, such as the games taking their style from the German bestsellers Der Schwarm and Tintenherz.


== Industry ==


=== Designers ===

Designers of Eurogames include:

Antoine Bauza, a prolific French designer, creator of 7 Wonders, Tokaido, and Takenoko.
Bruno Cathala, a French-born game designer, creator of Kingdomino and Five Tribes.
Vlaada Chvátil, a Czech designer of board games and video games, whose games include Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, Galaxy Trucker, Space Alert, and Codenames.  His rule books are often divided into several ""learning scenarios"" that gradually introduce players to the rules as they progress through the scenarios.
Leo Colovini, designer of Cartagena and Carcassonne: The Discovery.
Rüdiger Dorn, a German designer who created Istanbul, Karuba, Las Vegas, Luxor, and others.
Bruno Faidutti, French designer of Citadels.
Stefan Feld, designer particularly of games that make use of dice, and that allow players to score points in a variety of ways. He has designed games such as Castles of Burgundy and Trajan, and three of his games (Strasbourg, Bruges, and Carpe Diem) have been nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres.
Friedemann Friese, a German designer, creator of Power Grid, as well as many others.
Mac Gerdts, a German designer of games such as Antike, Imperial, Navegador, and Concordia.
Reiner Knizia, one of the most prolific German game designers, having designed over 600 published games. Recurring mechanisms in his games include auctions (Ra and Modern Art), tile placement (Tigris and Euphrates and Ingenious), and intricate scoring rules (Samurai). He has also designed many card games such as Lost Cities, Schotten-Totten, and Blue Moon, and the cooperative board game The Lord of the Rings.
Wolfgang Kramer, who often works with other game designers. His titles include El Grande, Tikal, Princes of Florence, and Torres. His games often have some sort of action point system, and include some geometric element.

=== Events ===

The Internationale Spieltage, also known as Essen Spiel, or the Essen Games Fair, is the largest non-digital game convention in the world, and the place where the largest number of Eurogames are released each year. Founded in 1983 and held annually in Essen, Germany, the fair was founded with the objective of providing a venue for people to meet and play board games, and show gaming as an integral part of German culture.
A ""World Boardgaming Championships"" is held annually in July in Pennsylvania, USA.  The event is nine days long and includes tournament tracks of over a hundred games; while traditional wargames are played there, all of the most popular tournaments are Eurogames and it is generally perceived as a Eurogame-centered event.  Attendance is international, though players from the U.S. and Canada predominate.


=== Awards ===
The most prestigious German board game award is the Spiel des Jahres (""Game of the Year""). The award is very family-oriented, with shorter, more approachable games such as Ticket to Ride and Elfenland usually preferred by the committee that gives out the award.
In 2011, the jury responsible for the Spiel des Jahres created the Kennerspiel des Jahres, or connoisseur's game of the year, for more complex games.
The Deutscher Spiele Preis (""German game prize"") is also awarded to games that are more complex and strategic, such as Puerto Rico. However, there are a few games with broad enough appeal to win both awards: The Settlers of Catan (1995), Carcassonne (2001), Dominion (2009).


== Influence ==
Xbox Live Arcade has included popular games from the genre, with Catan being released to strong sales on May 13, 2007, Carcassonne being released on June 27, 2007. Lost Cities and Ticket to Ride soon followed. Alhambra was due to follow later in 2007 until being cancelled.
The iPhone received versions of The Settlers of Catan and Zooloretto in 2009. Carcassonne was added to the iPhone App Store in June 2010. Later, Ticket to Ride was developed for both the iPhone and the iPad, significantly boosting sales of the board game.

Russian Railroads ,"Acquire locomotives & industry, build track, and hire the best engineers in Russia.",2013,2,4,4,90,120,12,3.41,Strategy,,"Diplomacy is a strategic board game created by Allan B. Calhamer in 1954 and released commercially in the United States in 1959. Its main distinctions from most board wargames are its negotiation phases (players spend much of their time forming and betraying alliances with other players and forming beneficial strategies) and the absence of dice and other game elements that produce random effects. Set in Europe in the years leading to the First World War, Diplomacy is played by two to seven players, each controlling the armed forces of a major European power (or, with fewer players, multiple powers). Each player aims to move their few starting units and defeat those of others to win possession of a majority of strategic cities and provinces marked as ""supply centers"" on the map; these supply centers allow players who control them to produce more units. Following each round of player negotiations, each player can issue attack and support orders, which are then executed during the movement phase. A player takes control of a province when the number of provinces that are given orders to support the attacking province exceeds the number of provinces given orders to support the defending province.
Diplomacy was the first commercially published game to be played by mail (PBM); only chess, which is in the public domain, saw significant postal play earlier. Diplomacy was also the first commercially published game to generate an active hobby scene with amateur fanzines; only science-fiction, fantasy and comics fandom saw fanzines earlier. Competitive face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments have been held since the 1970s. Play of Diplomacy by e-mail (PBEM) has been widespread since the late 1980s.
Diplomacy has been published in the United States by Games Research, Avalon Hill, and Hasbro; the name is currently a registered trademark of Hasbro's Avalon Hill division. Diplomacy has also been licensed to various companies for publication in other countries. Diplomacy is also played on the Internet, adjudicated by a computer or a human gamemaster.


== History ==
The idea for Diplomacy arose from Allan B. Calhamer's study at Harvard of nineteenth-century European history under Sidney B. Fay and from his study of political geography. Calhamer also drew inspiration from the card game of Hearts, in which he observed that players were at an advantage when they teamed up against the leader, and from the game of chess, which inspired him to use a limited number of spaces and pieces.
The rough form of Diplomacy was created in 1954, and its details were developed through playtesting until the 1958 map and rules revisions. Calhamer paid for a 500-game print run of that version in 1959 after rejection by major companies. It has been published since then by Games Research (in 1961, then a 1971 edition with a revised rulebook), Avalon Hill (in 1976), by Hasbro's Avalon Hill division (in 1999), and now by Wizards of the Coast (in 2008) in the US, and licensed to other boardgame publishers for versions sold in other countries. Among these are Parker Brothers, Waddingtons Games, Gibsons Games, and Asmodée Editions.
The first copy of the first print run was sold by the Calhamer estate through auction in 2017. 


== Basic setting and overview ==
The board is a map of 1901 Europe plus Turkey, Syria and North Africa. It is divided into fifty-six land regions and nineteen sea regions. Forty-two of the land regions are divided among the seven Great Powers of the game: Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.  The remaining fourteen land regions are neutral at the start of the game.
Thirty-four of the land regions contain ""supply centers"", corresponding to major centers of government, industry or commerce (e.g., Vienna and Rome); twenty-two of these are located within the Great Powers and are referred to as ""home"" supply centers. The remaining twelve are located in the neutral provinces. The number of supply centers a player controls determines the total number of armies and fleets a player may have on the board, and as players gain and lose control of centers, they may build (raise) or must remove (disband) units correspondingly.

The land provinces within the Great Powers which contain supply centers are generally named after a major city in the province (e.g. London and Moscow) while the other land provinces within the Great Powers are generally named after a region (e.g. Bohemia and Apulia). Neutral land provinces are generally named after countries (e.g. Serbia and Belgium).
All players other than Britain and Russia begin the game with two armies and one fleet; Britain starts with two fleets and one army, and Russia starts with two armies and two fleets, making it the only player to start the game with more than three units. Only one unit at a time may occupy a given map region. Balancing units to supply center counts is done after each game-year, which involves two seasons of play: Spring and Fall.
At the beginning of the game, the twelve neutral supply centers are typically captured within the first few moves. Further acquisition of supply centers becomes a zero sum dynamic with any gains in a player's resources coming at the expense of a rival.


== Historicity ==
Although the game starts in 1901, the map generally reflects the political boundaries of Europe in 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War. Bosnia is already annexed to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Balkans reflect the results of the wars of 1912 and 1913 in the region.
On the other hand, Montenegro is shown as part of Austria-Hungary. Additionally, North Africa and Tunis start the game as neutral, despite these regions being part of the French colonial empire in 1914. Finland and Syria are both parts of Great Powers, as Finland was part of the Russian Empire, and Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire in 1914. Tunis is used rather than Tunisia on most boards. North Africa is a single province covering parts of Algeria and Morocco.


== Comparison with other war games ==
Diplomacy differs from the majority of war games because:

Players do not take turns sequentially; instead all players secretly write down their moves after a negotiation period, then all moves are revealed and put into effect simultaneously.
Social interaction and interpersonal skills make up an essential part of the play.
The rules that simulate combat are strategic, abstract, and simple—not tactical, realistic, or complex—as this is a diplomatic simulation game, not a military one.
Combat resolution contains no random elements—no dice are rolled or cards drawn.
Each military unit has the same strength.
It is especially well suited to postal play, which led to an active hobby of amateur publishing.
Internet Diplomacy is one of the few early board games that is still played on the web.
The game board is on the scale of an entire continent, rather than a single campaign theater.
Land and sea power are almost equally significant, and a player's decision as to whether to raise an army or a fleet is highly significant.


== Gameplay ==
Diplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the ""Spring"" and ""Fall"" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by ""retreat"" or ""disband"" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.


=== Negotiation phase ===
In the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.
Communication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.


=== Movement phase ===
After the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a ""convoy"". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).
Certain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.


=== End-of-year and supply centers ===
After each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw – around half of all games will end in a draw.


== Variants ==
Several boardgames based on Diplomacy have been commercially published. Additionally, many fans of the game have created hundreds of variants of their own, using altered rules on the standard map, standard rules on a different map, or both.


=== Rulebook provision for fewer than seven players ===
The rules allow for games with two to six players, closing parts of the standard board, but these are used only in casual play, and are not considered standard Diplomacy in tournament, postal, or most forms of online play. For example, if there are six players, everyone plays one country and Italy is not used; for five players, Italy and Germany are not used. The original rules did not include additional guidelines, but the Avalon Hill set included suggestions, such as individual players using multiple countries, and additions.
Another approach to solving the problem of fewer than seven players is the use of the Escalation Variant Rules by Edi Birsan:

Players start with no pieces on the board
Players put one piece down on the board in any province one at a time (starting with the youngest player)
After reaching the maximum number of pieces the players start the game with ownership of their starting provinces.
At the end of Fall 1901 with their adjustments players write down their three HOME centers for the rest of the game.
This is done without negotiations and may result in two players declaring the same province. However, in order to build there they still must own it and the province must be open. Players may choose any supply center as a HOME for example: EDI, DEN, ROM
It is suggested that for the number players the following starting pieces are used:

Two – 12 units
Three – 8 units
Four − 6 units
Five – 5 units
Six – 4 units
It is also suggested that for games with 2–4 players that the 'Gunboat' rule applies which means that there are no discussions.
For 4 or 5 players, it is suggested that the 'Wilson' or 'Public Press' rule applies which means that all discussions must take place in the open at the table with no whispers or secret signals.
For 5 or 6 players, it is suggested that regular negotiation rules apply.
The following are the current official suggestions:


==== Alternative way to play ====
The following is an alternative way to play the game of Diplomacy when fewer than seven players are present.

Six Players
Eliminate Italy. Italian units hold in position and defend themselves, but don't support each other. Units belonging to any of the players can support them in their holding position. If Italian units are forced to retreat, they're disbanded.
Five Players
Eliminate Italy and Germany (as described for Italy above).
Four Players
One player plays Britain, and the other three play the following pairs: Austria/France, Germany/Turkey, and Italy/Russia.
Three Players
One player controls Britain/Germany/Austria; the second, Russia/Italy; and the third, France/Turkey. Or one player plays Britain/Austria; one plays France/Russia; one plays Germany/Turkey. In this version Italy is not played.
Three Players (alternative)
One person plays Russia while the other two control Britain/France/Germany and Austria/Italy/Turkey.
Two Players
This version can be played as a World War I simulation. One player controls Britain/France/Russia while the other plays Austria/Germany/Turkey. Italy is neutral and Italian territory can't be entered. The game begins in 1914. Before the Fall 1914 adjustments, flip a coin. Italy joins the winner of the toss in Spring 1915. The first player to control 24 supply centers wins. This is also a way for two new players to learn the rules.
In games for two, three, or four players, supply-center ownership is computed for each individual country, even though the same person plays more than one country. As with the regular rules, adjustments must be made by each country in accordance with its supply-center holdings.


=== Commercially published Diplomacy variants ===
There have been six commercially released variants of Diplomacy — Machiavelli, Kamakura, Colonial Diplomacy, Hundred, Ard-Rí and Classical. Imperial is a boardgame with enough similarities to be described as a Diplomacy variant by some.


==== Machiavelli ====

Machiavelli was published by Battleline Publications, later taken over by Avalon Hill. Set in Renaissance Italy, the board is controlled by the Republic of Florence, the Republic of Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, the Papacy, Valois France, Habsburg Austria, and the Ottoman Turks. The game introduces many rules changes such as money, bribery, three seasons per year, garrisons, and random events such as plague and famine. It features scenarios tailored for as few as four and as many as eight players.


==== Kamakura ====
Kamakura was published by West End Games in the early 1980s. Its setting is feudal Japan.


==== Colonial Diplomacy ====
Published by Avalon Hill in 1994. It is set in Asia in the late 19th century, and much of the board is controlled by various colonial powers: the United Kingdom, the Russian Empire, the Empire of Japan, Holland, Ottoman Empire, China, and France. The game introduces three special features:

The Trans-Siberian railroad extends across Russia from Moscow to Vladivostok. The railroad can be used by Russia to move armies anywhere along the railroad. The TSR may only be used by Russia. Russian armies are allowed to move through other Russian armies, but foreign armies can block the passage of armies on the TSR.
The Suez Canal is the only way to move between the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea. Use of the Suez Canal is controlled by whoever is in control of  Egypt. The use of the Suez Canal increases in importance later in the game as expansion becomes both more important and more difficult.
The ownership of Hong Kong counts as a supply center for any country except China.
This map was used as the basis of the Imperial Asia expansion map.
Colonial Diplomacy won in a tie the Origins Award for Best Pre-20th Century Board Game of 1995.


==== Hundred ====
Hundred is a map for three players by Andy D. Schwarz based on the Hundred Years' War created in 1996 and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Ard-Rí ====
Ard-Rí is a map by Stuart John Bernard based on pre-Christian Ireland (though it anachronistically includes Vikings), created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000. Ard-Rí happens to also be the name of a hnefatafl variant played in Ancient Ireland.


==== Classical ====
Classical is a map by Andy D. Schwarz and Vincent Mous based on the ancient world after the death of Alexander the Great, created in 1998, and published by Stupendous Games in 2000.


==== Diplomacy of the Three Kingdoms ====
Based on the Three Kingdoms in Ancient China, it was created by Edi Birsan to introduce the basic ideas of the main game to a Chinese audience with a setting more close to their own historical experience. It was published by MJS Creations in 2008.


=== Diplomacy variants not commercially published ===
A wide range of other variants of Diplomacy have been created and played without being commercially published. These include settings such as the ancient and renaissance world. Some variants use new maps and rules, while others simply vary the original game, such as the Fleet Rome variant which replaces the starting Italian army in Rome with a fleet.


==== Youngstown ====
One of the most notable non-commercially published is the Youngstown variant which is an extension of the normal map, including Asia and colonies there. For example, in addition to the usual home centers, France starts with a fleet in Saigon (in Cochinchina). Three new Powers were added – India, China, and Japan - with powers without historical Asian colonies being given more home centers. The variant was named after the city of Youngstown, Ohio where the variant was invented.


== Tournaments ==

Diplomacy is played at a number of formal tournaments in many nations. Most face-to-face Diplomacy tournaments longer than one day are associated with either a Diplomacy-centered convention (such as DipCon or Dixiecon) or a large multi-game convention (such as the Origins Game Fair or the World Boardgaming Championships). Some conventions are centered on the games and have a highly competitive atmosphere; others have more focus on meeting and socializing with other players from the postal or e-mail parts of the hobby.


=== Tournament play ===
In some tournaments, each game ends after a specified number of game-years, to ensure that all players can play in all rounds without limiting the tournament structure to one round per day. At other events, a game continues until a winner is determined or a draw is voted. Tournaments in Europe are generally played with a specific end year whereas tournaments in North America more often are played until someone wins or a draw is agreed.


=== Major championship tournaments ===
The World Diplomacy Convention (WDC or World DipCon) is held annually in different places in the world. The winner of WDC is considered to be the World Champion of Diplomacy. WDC was first held in 1988 in Birmingham, England, and was held at two-year intervals before becoming an annual event. WDC's site moves among four regions: North America, Europe, Australasia, and the rest of the world, with a requirement that successive WDC's are always held in different regions.
The North American Diplomacy Convention (DipCon) is held annually in different places in North America, to determine the North American Champion of Diplomacy. DipCon was first held in 1966 in Youngstown, Ohio. DipCon's site rotates among West, Central, and East regions.
The European Diplomacy Convention (Euro DipCon) is held annually in different places in Europe, to determine the European Champion of Diplomacy.
Over a dozen other countries hold face-to-face national championship tournaments.


=== Other major face-to-face tournaments ===
Many of the larger multi-game conventions, such as the World Boardgaming Championships, Gen Con, Origins, ManorCon, TempleCon, and Dragonflight also host Diplomacy tournaments. On occasion, WDC or DipCon will be held in conjunction with one of these conventions.
In addition, many of the larger local and regional clubs host tournaments on an annual basis and always encourage visitors from the local area as well as any travelers from around the globe.


=== Major play-by-email tournaments ===
The play-by-email field is constantly changing. There are numerous tournaments generally associated with different websites. As of 2008 there were no official events sanctioned by the manufacturer (Wizards/Avalon Hill). There have been and continue to be events with various sizes and self designated titles such as:

World Masters – every two years in the Worldmasters E-mail Tournament composed of both team and individual events
Diplomacy World Cup – modeled after a Soccer World Cup (players are in teams competing by countries), there have been two world cups so far and a third is under way. The first took place 2007-9 and was won by France, the second 2010-12 and was won by Ireland, and the third version started in January 2013.
Winter Blitz – The 4th Annual Winter Blitz became open to join in 2011.


== Other ways to play ==

Despite the length of face-to-face Diplomacy games, there are people who organize and host games, and there are also various clubs that have annual tournaments and monthly club games.
To overcome the difficulty of assembling enough players for a sufficiently large block of time together, a play-by-mail game community has developed, either via Postal or Internet Diplomacy, using either humans to adjudicate the turns or automatic adjudicators. The current largest example of a dedicated online Diplomacy server with automatic adjudicators is Backstabbr.com, developed by Tile Games.


=== Postal and email play ===

Since the 1960s, Diplomacy has been played by mail through fanzines. The play-by-mail (PBM) hobby was created in 1963 by Dr. John Boardman of New York City. He did so in carbon-copied typed flyers, recruiting players through his science fiction fanzine Knowable. His flyers became an ongoing publication under the Graustark title, and led directly to the formation of other zines. Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax was also a Diplomacy PBM player in the 1960s.
By May 1965 there were eight Diplomacy zines. By the end of 1967 there were dozens of zines in the US, and by 1970 their editors were holding gatherings. In 1969, Don Turnbull started the first UK-based Diplomacy zine, Albion. These were ""affectionately"" known as ""Dippy zines"". Prior to the 1980s, most had circulations of about 50 subscribers, but some had hundreds.
By 1972, both the US and UK hobbies were forming organizations. In the 1980s, there were over sixty zines, such as Diplomacy World and the like, in the main list of the North American Zine Poll, peaking at 72 zines in 1989; and there were nearly as many in the major Zine Poll of the British part of the hobby.

Competition was fierce, leading some Diplomacy PBM players to ""go to great lengths to win"". In the UK, this included, in a few cases, bribery, blackmail, and even forging mail from other players or the Gamemaster, as well as mail interference (for example altering a letter to ensure a missed deadline was marked in time by a forged postmark). According to reviewer Martin Croft, in the early 1980s, Two players managed to get into trouble with the police ... [while] involved in complex negotiations about an attack on the gamer playing Britain. To avoid postal delays, one sent the other a telegram which read ATTACK ON LIVERPOOL CONFIRMED. Both spent some time explaining to the police that it was only a game.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the number of postal Diplomacy zines has reduced as new players instead joined the part of the hobby that plays over the internet via e-mail or on websites. In April 2010, Graustark itself ceased publication.  As of 2011, there are only a few active postal zines published in the US, one each in Canada and Australia, and several in the UK and elsewhere. In order to reduce postage and printing costs, as well as for environmental reasons, several zines (e.g. Western Front, Maniacs Paradise) are distributed to subscribers via emailed links to the zine's web page when a new issue appears, or are emailed out as PDF files, for subscribers to read on screen or print out as they choose. Some zines maintain a dual existence as paper and digital publications.
The first known electronic Diplomacy zine was Mad As Hell, distributed on Usenet in 1982. Diplomacy has been played through e-mail on the Internet since the 1983 debut of The Armchair Diplomat on Compuserve.  The GEnie online service offered fully automated versions of Diplomacy and variants to subscribers.


=== Diplomacy computer games ===

Avalon Hill released a computer game version of Diplomacy in 1984 for the IBM PC. Computer Gaming World in 1987 stated that its computer opponents ""simply stay the appetite of zealous Diplomacy players until they can gather flesh and blood victims"". The magazine in 1994 described it as ""a flop"".
Hasbro Interactive released a computer game version of Diplomacy (called Avalon Hill's Diplomacy) in 1999 under the MicroProse label, and developed by Meyer/Glass Interactive. A major fault, like with the Avalon Hill version, was that the computer AI was considered poor, one reviewer remarking ""Gamers of any skill level will have no trouble whatsoever whaling on the computer at even the highest difficulty setting.""
Paradox Interactive released a new computer version in 2005, which was given negative reviews, partly due to the odd grunts the game used to express the reactions of the AI players during the Movement phase. None of the computer games supported either text or voice chat, which limited the possibilities for complicated alliances.  In 2011, artificial intelligence scholars noted that work on Diplomacy-focused AI has been carried out since mid-1980s, but so far this endeavour met ""little success"".
The first artificial-intelligence Diplomacy conquest was organized in 2015 as part of the International Computer Game Association.
The first place in the contest was won by Dave de Jonge. 
In November 2022, Meta Platforms announced that they had developed an AI to play Diplomacy online at a competitive level, ranking in the top 10% of players.


== Reception ==
In his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nick Palmer thought that despite ""primitive"" movement and combat rules, ""the game has an extraordinary charm all its own, based on the fascinating interplay of alliances between the seven players"". He concluded, ""This can be strongly recommended to anyone interested in games of multi-player negotiation"".
In the 1980 book The Complete Book of Wargames, game designer Jon Freeman called this game ""Probably the most famous wargame in existence ... The double-dealing required attracts some people irresistibly and repels others just as strongly, but the interaction in Diplomacy is the model for all other 'power politics' games."" Freeman only had two issues with the game: ""the number of players required and the time it takes to play."" Freeman gave the game an overall evaluation of ""Excellent"", concluding, ""This is a classic game in every sense of the word.""
Diplomacy was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Game designer Larry Harris explained: ""I am convinced that Allan Calhamer's masterpiece should be part of every high school curriculum. Don't tell the kids, but it teaches history, geography, the art of political negotiation, and something else – some healthy critical skepticism. By the time you get into high school, you have a pretty good idea that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!""
In its catalog, Avalon Hill advertised Diplomacy as the favorite game of John F. Kennedy. Gyles Brandreth, in the UK magazine Games & Puzzles   claimed Diplomacy was Henry Kissinger's favorite game. American broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite is reported to have been a fan of the game. Michael Portillo, British journalist, broadcaster, and former Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, is known to have played the game while studying at Harrow County School for Boys.
Diplomacy was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Adventure Hall of Fame in 1994.

Diplomacy   at BoardGameGeek"
Tigris & Euphrates,Keep your Mesopotamian civilisation in perfect balance through revolutions and wars.,1997,2,4,4,90,90,12,3.51,Strategy,,"Board games are tabletop games that typically use pieces. These pieces are moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing surface) and often include elements of table, card, role-playing, and miniatures games as well.
Many board games feature a competition between two or more players. To show a few examples: in checkers (British English name 'draughts'), a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces, while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team, and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person.
There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, such as in snakes and ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader. Play components now often include custom figures or shaped counters, and distinctively shaped player pieces commonly known as meeples as well as traditional cards and dice.
The time required to learn or master gameplay varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily related to the number or complexity of rules; for example, chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets but have great strategic depth.


== History ==


=== Ancient ===
Classical board games are divided into four categories: race games (such as pachisi), space games (such as noughts and crosses), chase games (such as hnefatafl), and games of displacement (such as chess).
Board games have been played, traveled, and evolved in most cultures and societies throughout history. Several important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as Jiroft civilization game boards in Iran. Senet, found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively, is the oldest board game known to have existed. Senet was pictured in a fresco painting found in Merknera's tomb (3300–2700 BC). Also from predynastic Egypt is mehen.
Hounds and jackals, another ancient Egyptian board game, appeared around 2000 BC. The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb that dates to the 13th dynasty. This game was also popular in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.
Backgammon originated in ancient Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago.  Ashtapada, chess, pachisi and chaupar originated in India. Go and liubo originated in China. Patolli originated in Mesoamerica played by the ancient Aztecs and the royal game of Ur was found in the royal tombs of Ur, dating to Mesopotamia 4,600 years ago.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== European ===

Board games have a long tradition in Europe. The oldest records of board gaming in Europe date back to Homer's Iliad (written in the 8th century BC), in which he mentions the Ancient Greek game of petteia. This game of petteia would later evolve into the Roman ludus latrunculorum. Board gaming in ancient Europe was not unique to the Greco-Roman world, with records estimating that the ancient Norse game of hnefatafl was developed sometime before 400AD. In ancient Ireland, the game of fidchell or ficheall, is said to date back to at least 144 AD, though this is likely an anachronism. A fidchell board dating from the 10th century has been uncovered in Co. Westmeath, Ireland.
The association of dice and cards with gambling led to all dice games except backgammon being treated as lotteries by dice in the gaming acts of 1710 and 1845. Early board game producers in the second half of the eighteenth century were mapmakers. The global popularization of Board Games, with special themes and branding, coincided with the formation of the global dominance of the British Empire. John Wallis was an English board game publisher, bookseller, map/chart seller, printseller, music seller, and cartographer. With his sons John Wallis Jr. and Edward Wallis, he was one of the most prolific publishers of board games of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. John Betts' A Tour of the British Colonies and Foreign Possessions and William Spooner's A Voyage of Discovery were popular in the British empire. Kriegsspiel is a genre of wargaming developed in 19th century Prussia to teach battle tactics to officers.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== American ===

The board game Travellers' Tour Through the United States and its sister game Traveller's Tour Through Europe were published by New York City bookseller F. & R. Lockwood in 1822 and claim the distinction of being the first board games published in the United States.
Margaret Hofer described the period of the 1880s–1920s as ""The Golden Age"" of board gaming in America. Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through mass production, which made them cheaper and more easily available.


=== Chinese, Arabic, and Indian ===
Outside of Europe and the U.S., many traditional board games are popular. In China, Go and many variations of chess are popular. In Africa and the Middle East, mancala is a popular board game archetype with many regional variations. In India, a community game called Carrom is popular.


=== Modern ===

In the late 1990s, companies began producing more new games to serve a growing worldwide market. In the 2010s, several publications said board games were amid a new Golden Age or ""renaissance"". Board game venues also grew  in popularity; in 2016 alone, more than 5,000 board game cafés opened in the U.S., and they were reported to be very popular in China as well. 
Board games have been used as a mechanism for science communication.


== Luck, strategy, and diplomacy ==
Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as Candy Land and snakes and ladders require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.

Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in backgammon, Monopoly, or Risk; but over many games, a skilled player will win more often. The elements of luck can also make for more excitement at times, and allow for more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered.
Luck may be introduced into a game by several methods. The use of dice of various sorts goes back to the earliest board games. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly, to how their forces fare in battle, as in Risk, or which resources a player gains, as in Catan. Other games such as Sorry! use a deck of special cards that, when shuffled, create randomness. Scrabble does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. German-style board games are notable for often having fewer elements of luck than many North American board games. Luck may be reduced in favour of skill by introducing symmetry between players. For example, in a dice game such as Ludo, by giving each player the choice of rolling the dice or using the previous player's roll.
Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players, making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, cooperative games being the exception. An important facet of Catan, for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In Risk, two or more players may team up against others. Easy diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Advanced diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game Diplomacy) consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.
In perfect information games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as Tigris and Euphrates or Stratego, some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.


== Software ==

Many board games are now available as video games. These are aptly termed digital board games, and their distinguishing characteristic compared to traditional board games is they can now be played online against a computer or other players. Some websites (such as boardgamearena.com, yucata.de, etc.) allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use email to notify the players after each move. The Internet and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed. Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or DVDs in accompaniment to the game.

There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as Vassal, Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds that are more specialized for role-playing games. Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, Fantasy Grounds has licenses for both Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder materials, while Tabletop Simulator allows game publishers to provide paid downloadable content for their games. However, as these games offer the ability to add in the content through user modifications, there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.


== Market ==

While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for video games, it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s. A 2012 article in The Guardian described board games as ""making a comeback"". Other expert sources suggest that board games never went away, and that board games have remained a popular leisure activity which has only grown over time.  Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at ""between 25% and 40% annually"" since 2010, and described the current time as the ""golden era for board games"". The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant mechanics, components, artwork, and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet. Crowd-sourcing for board games is a large facet of the market, with $233 million raised on Kickstarter in 2020.
A 1991 estimate for the global board game market was over $1.2 billion. A 2001 estimate for the United States ""board games and puzzle"" market gave a value of under $400 million, and for United Kingdom, of about £50 million. A 2009 estimate for the Korean market was put at 800 million won, and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about $800 million. A 2011 estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over 10 billion yuan. A 2013 estimate put the size of the German toy market at 2.7 billion euros (out of which the board games and puzzle market is worth about 375 million euros), and Polish markets at 2 billion and 280 million zlotys, respectively. In 2009, Germany was considered to be the best market per capita, with the highest number of games sold per individual.


=== Hobby board games ===
Some academics, such as Erica Price and Marco Arnaudo, have differentiated ""hobby"" board games and gamers from other board games and gamers. A 2014 estimate placed the U.S. and Canada market for hobby board games (games produced for a ""gamer"" market) at only $75 million, with the total size of what it defined as the ""hobby game market"" (""the market for those games regardless of whether they're sold in the hobby channel or other channels,"") at over $700 million. A similar 2015 estimate suggested a hobby game market value of almost $900 million.


== Research ==

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as game studies or ludology.
While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess, Go, mancala), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk, and especially modern board games such as Catan, Agricola, and Pandemic. Much research has been carried out on chess, partly because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, Herbert A. Simon, and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing ability.
Linearly arranged board games have improved children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a number line in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.
Research studies show that board games such as Snakes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation, and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece. Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's executive functions and help reduce risks of dementia for the elderly. Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility, culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities.

Additionally, board games can be therapeutic. Bruce Halpenny, a games inventor said when interviewed about his game, The Great Train Robbery:With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player's imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble, they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society because most jobs are boring and repetitive.
Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to the traditional educational curriculum if the content is appropriate and the gameplay informs students on the curriculum content.


== Categories ==
There are several ways in which board games can be classified, and considerable overlap may exist, so that a game belongs to several categories.
The namesake of the board game, gameboards would seem to be a necessary and sufficient condition of the genre, though card games that do not use a standard deck of cards (as well as games that use neither cards nor a gameboard) are often colloquially included, with some scholars therefore referring to said genre as that of ""table and board games"" or ""tabletop games"", or seeing board games as a subgenre or tabletop games.: 5 : 1 
H. J. R. Murray's A History of Board Games Other Than Chess (1952) has been called the first attempt to develop a ""scheme for the classification of board games"". David Parlett's Oxford History of Board Games (1999) defines four primary categories: race games (where the goal is to be the first to move all one's pieces to the final destination), space games (in which the object is to arrange the pieces into some special configuration), chase games (asymmetrical games, where players start the game with different sets of pieces and objectives) and displace games (where the main objective is the capture the opponents' pieces). Parlett also distinguishes between abstract and thematic games, the latter having a specific theme or frame narrative (ex. regular chess versus, for example, Star Wars-themed chess).

The following is a list of some of the most common game categories:


== Glossary ==

Although many board games have a jargon all their own, there is a generalized terminology to describe concepts applicable to basic game mechanics and attributes common to nearly all board games.

Decrypto,Decipher your opponents' code before they decipher yours. Don't get caught.,2018,3,8,"4, 6",15,45,12,1.8,Party,,"Ticket to Ride is a series of railway-themed Eurogames designed by Alan R. Moon, the first of which was released in 2004 by Days of Wonder. The game has sold over 10 million copies, amounting to a total estimated revenue of over $400 million (USD). Days of Wonder has released electronic versions of the board games in the series, as well as ""Ticket to Ride""-themed card games and puzzles.


== Gateway game ==
The introductory nature of the ""Ticket to Ride"" has been noted. Alan R. Moon, wrote ""The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route or get more destination tickets"". Days of Wonder wrote in its promotion that ""Ticket to Ride's elegantly simple gameplay can be learned in less than five minutes."" In 2006, Eric Hautemont (Days of Wonder CEO) in 2006 wrote ""Ticket to Ride has universal appeal ... Moon's simple, yet elegant design delivers a great gaming experience, whether you're a first-time player or a dedicated gamer. It's the perfect gateway into the new world of boardgaming.""
Chris Heindenriecht (Gameology), when listing notable gateway games, ""those games striking a balance between simplicity and depth, making them perfect for beginners and seasoned gamers alike"", argued that ""Ticket to Ride is a classic gateway game that combines strategy, route-building, and a touch of luck"". With respect to the game's ability to get new players into board gaming, ""Ticket to Ride"" scored second in a 2019 Meeple Mountain survey of over 800 people, in the critical ability of bringing new people into the market and by capturing more spending of existing gamers.


== Reception ==


=== Sales ===
The very first sale of the game to German distributor was 600 units, shipped on 27 February 2004, with French and English sales coming soon after. On 12 November 2004, nine months after its release, 250,000 copies of the Ticket to Ride board game had been sold. As of 2022, it is estimated that over 10 million copies have been sold, translated into 33 different languages, distributed in more than 40 different countries, and played by more than 80 million people. The estimate of copies of the board game sold show a consist increase:


=== Critical Reception ===
The reception to the Ticket to Ride series, as a whole, had been generally positive. Giving the series an 8.6 out of 10, Board Game Halv wrote ""Ticket to Ride is one of the most popular games in the world, period. They have painstakingly earned that distinction over several years and sever iterations of the game so it is all well deserved.""


== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is based on the formate of the original 2004 game's rules (United States 1910), with a few unique rule variations for each version:- 


=== Set-up ===

At the beginning of each version of the game:

Each player selects a prescribed number of coloured train pieces specified for that version, with a matching scoring marker.
Players are usually dealt a 4 train car cards. The exception are the cities' versions (2 train cards); France (8 train cards); Rails and Sails (3 cards, with 7 ship cards); Great Lakes (2 cards with 2 ship cards); United Kingdom (an additional wild card); and Africa (an additional terrain card).
Players are also dealt a prescribed number of destination ticket cards which show a route between specified destination cities, the numbers of which are specified in that version's rules. Each player must keep a prescribed number of those assigned ticket cards, but can discard any other unwanted tickets. Retained destination tickets may not be discarded for the rest of the game.


=== Play ===
Each turn, the player chooses from one of three options:

Draw two railway car cards in various colours from the face-up 5 draw cards or the pack. The Rails and Sails and Great Lakes versions use two draw card piles of 3 train cards and 3 ship cards instead), with the restriction that drawing a face-up wild Locomotive card forfeits drawing another card for that turn (this restriction does not exist in the Switzerland map). Any removed face-up draw cards are automatically replaced, with all the face-up draw cards being immediately completely replaced if three or more wild locomotive cards are face-up; or
Draw a number of additional destination ticket cards, specified by the version being played, keeping a specified minimum number in that version; or
Play their collected railway car cards from their hand to claim a route on the board and place the corresponding number of train pieces from their store on the claimed route. The routes are of varied lengths, and only one player can claim each discrete route marked on the board. Some cities are connected by two parallel routes that can be claimed by two different players (unless the game is played with a number of players lower than a stated threshold of players, in which case only one of the routes can be claimed). A single player may not claim both parallel routes between two cities. On their turn, a player can claim any route on the board that has not already been claimed, regardless of whether the route helps to complete their destination tickets.
The game ends when one player possesses a number of their remaining coloured train pieces which falls below three trains (except for the Rails and Sails version, which is ended when the combined number of any player's own trains/ships falls below 7). Every player then takes one additional turn (two turns in the Rails and Sails version) and then reveals their previously hidden retained ticket cards.


=== Scoring ===

Players can earn points by:

Routes – The points awarded for a route are based on the number of wagons required for that route, using a standard point value for every version.
Tickets – The combined prescribed points on the ticket cards whose objectives have been completed, i.e. by connecting specified cities in one of their ticket cards (occasional in a specific order), once the combined prescribed points of any ticket cards with uncompleted objectives have been subtracted.
Longest Road – A 10 point bonus for the player, or each player for those tied in length, who has built the longest continuous route. In some versions, there is a ""globetrotter"" instead, i.e. a road from one end of the board to the other, with each player potentially obtaining the points if they build it. Some versions do not have this bonus.
Most Completed Tickets – A point bonus for the player, or each player for those that tied in number, who completed the most tickets (10 or 15 points depending on the version). Some versions do not have this bonus.
Some versions have additional special rules.


== Stand alone versions ==
The game's original version is played on a board depicting a railway map of the United States and southern Canada, however, localised editions have subsequently been published depicting maps of other countries, cities, and regions, many of which have been positively received by critics. The transport cards are based on various models of train carriages:

Each stand alone game has its own sets of standard plastic train pieces, in the following colours:

† Rails and Sails contained train and ship tokens of a smaller size to the standard train token.  
Pink Tokens - On 27 September 2021, Days of Wonder announced the launch of set of classic pink colored game tokens, a colour-themed campaign long associated with the breast cancer. The initial limited release of these pink tokens was during 8 October 2021 - 29 October 2011. These tokens were produced as part of a premier partnership between Asmodee and Humble Bundle with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), the first type of such partnership in the board game industry. The token were first released worldwide in October 2021, as a limited release of 80,000, for the suggested retail price of $5 (USD) / 5€ with $2 (USD) / €2 from each purchase being donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. On 14 December 2021, Asmodee and Days of Wonder, announced over 40,000 physical unit were sold in 18 countries (France, Italy, Belgium, and Poland selling out of stock in the first 10 days) and over 67,000 digital units were sold, raising over $184,000 (USD). Since then, these tokens have been released in October each year. 
Some versions had special tokens for that versions unique rules, e.g. passengers, meeples, stations, harbours, bullets trains etc.


=== Ticket to Ride (Original) ===

The original version was based on a map of 1910 United States. It was released in late February 2004 in Europe and in late March 2004 in Korea and North America, at a suggested retail price of $US 39.95. It features ""railway routes connecting cities throughout North America"", and was released in 2004, published by Days of Wonder. The recommendation is that it is played with only 2–5 players, who are aged 8 or older, for a game lasting between 30–60 minutes. In 2008, Days of Wonder released USA 1910, a card expansion that contains additional destination tickets and larger decks for both routes and railway cards to replace the much smaller ones included in the original game.
The box of the original version of Ticket to Ride is 30 cm × 30 cm × 8 cm. Influenced in part by the game's popularity, these dimensions have become a very popular standard for medium-size games, and are commonly referred to as ""standard TtR size"".

10th Anniversary Edition – After the official announcement of its release on 13 February 2014, in May 2014 in Europe and in June 2014 globally (including the United States), the company released Ticket to Ride: 10th Anniversary at a suggested retail price of €80 and $100 respectively. Whilst there were no rule changes to the original game (USA), the edition had a larger (50%) newly illustrated map, large format playing cards, and metal boxes for its 5 sets of uniquely-designed train pieces. The USA 1910 expansion is also included in this version.
Ticket to Ride: 15th Anniversary – A 15th Anniversary edition was released in August 2019 with translucent train cars and a special booklet detailing the history of the game. The card borders and backs were updated and are clearer and more vibrant than in earlier editions. There are no rule changes to the game and no expansions are included in this edition.
Reception – Board Gaming, when giving the game a 7.8 out of 10, wrote ""A game almost everyone loves to play. It's easy to learn and quick to play, which makes it ideal for introducing you, your friends and your family to board games."" ""Ticket To Ride is a classic game and there is a reason why it has won so many awards. Its accessibility for those not accustomed to the modern era of board gaming means everyone will enjoy it. Giving the game a 4.7 out of 10, ""Board Game Review"" wrote, ""Those in the board game community call games like these ‘Entry Level’. Ticket To Ride epitomises this term and is one of the best entry level games.""
The original Ticket to Ride version won the following awards:

As of August 2008, over 750,000 copies of the game had been sold according to the publisher. As of October 2014, over three million copies were reported sold, with retail sales of over $150 million.
Mike Fitzgerald called Ticket to Ride ""a game that I never tire of, one that lends itself well to the many expansions that Days of Wonder have released. The design principles it uses are all simple and have been done before, but they have never been put together in a game as compelling as Ticket to Ride."" Board Game Quest mentioned that it is ""one of the greatest gateway games ever made"", and Board Games Land described it as ""one of the best family board games ever made"".

A Europe version was released in 2005. Ticket to Ride: Europe takes place on a map of Europe as it was at the turn of the 20th century. Two new types of routes were introduced: Ferry routes that require locomotive cards to be played when claiming them, and tunnel routes which add the risk that additional train cards may be necessary to complete the route. The game includes ""stations"" which allow the player to use a route owned by another player and thus complete their destination ticket. In 2009, DOW released Europe 1912, a card expansion for the European game. It contains additional destination tickets, and an additional play mechanic— Warehouses. In 2015, DOW released a mini extension Orient Express, containing eight destination tickets featuring a route of the Orient Express.

15th Anniversary Edition – Similar to the original's 10th-anniversary edition, a larger map of Europe was released in late spring (8 July 2021) in North America and Europe at a suggested retail price of $99.95/€99.99 respectively. While this edition had the same rules as ""Ticket to Ride – Europe"", this edition included a larger newly designed board and custom train/station playing pieces in metal tin boxes, with the green train being replaced by pink ones. It also featured the destination cards from the original game, Europe 1912, Orient Express, and a promo card, bringing the count to 108.
Reception – The Ticket to Ride: Europe version won the following awards:


=== Ticket to Ride: Märklin ===
A German version, Ticket to Ride: Märklin, was released in 2006 by Märklin, a German toy company best known for model railways and technical toys. Whereas railway car cards of each type in the previous games were identical, the cards in Ticket to Ride: Märklin each show a different image of Märklin rolling stock. This edition features a passenger mechanic, where a passenger token is placed on the board, and can claim point tokens by travelling along a player's route.
Reception – The Ticket to Ride: Märklin version won the following awards:


=== Ticket to Ride: Switzerland ===
In 2007, a game entitled Ticket to Ride: Switzerland was released,  as the 4th Big Box release after the Europe and Marklin versions of Ticket to Ride. This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.95 out of 5. This initial single-map release was designed for a 2–3 player game lasting 30–50 minutes. It was later re-released in the expansion entitled Volume 2: India + Switzerland in 2011.
Reception –  For its 2007 release, the Switzerland map received favourable reviews. On I Slay the Dragon the expansion revieced a 9 out of 10, with the reviewer writing Ticket to Ride: Switzerland, while perhaps not the chosen map for casual play, is the ideal choice for competitive two-player games. The game is short, tense, and exhilarating. I like the new rules for the map, and even though swings in luck can be frustrating, they usually affect both players and are just factors necessary to consider when choosing a strategy.""


=== Ticket to Ride: Nordic countries ===
Released in late October 2007, this version is based on a map focused on the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), but additionally has cities in Estonia and Russia. This version also incorporates the ferry routes and tunnels from ""Ticket to Ride: Europe"". Players only receive a set of 40 coloured train pieces for this version. The recommendation is that it is played with only 2–3 players, who are aged 8 or older, for a game lasting between 30–60 minutes. Following its success in the eponymous countries, this version also became available in the English, French, and German languages.


=== Ticket to Ride: Germany ===
In September 2012, Zug um Zug: Deutschland (German: [Zug əm Zug: Deutschland], Ticket to Ride: Germany) was released by Asmodee, Days of Wonder's German distributor, solely in the German language. It was developed and produced specifically at Asmodee's request (as Ticket to Ride: Märklin had gone out of print) and was only available in Germany and Austria. This version was based on a map of late-20th century Germany, with the same route layout as in the Märklin version. In 2015, Asmodee released Deutschland 1902, a card expansion for this German map that contained additional destination tickets.
On 12 April 2017, Days of Wonder announced its pending release of a version entitled Ticket to Ride: Germany for the English speaking market, similarly based on a map of Germany at the end of the 19th century. This version was released in June 2017 in Europe and then subsequently in August 2017 in the United States through its American premiere release at booth #1619 of Gen Con (17–20 August 2017), at a suggested retail price of €44 and $50 (USD) respectively.  This version was a combination of Zug um Zug: Deutschland together with Deutschland 1902, with the same map as Ticket to Ride: Märklin and likewise including that game's passenger mechanism. The game was designed for 2–5 players aged 8-years-old or older for a game lasting 30–60 minutes. Adrien Martinot (Days of Wonder general manager) wrote ""We decided to release this version, which was limited to German market only, in order to answer the demand of all Ticket to Ride fans worldwide"".
Reception – The reviews were generally positive. Derek Thompson (Geeks under Grace) wrote ""If you don't want to get the original base game or are just looking for a second standalone, I would actually venture to say that this is the best standalone box."" Jennifer Derrick (I Slay the Dragon), while giving it an 8.8 out of 10, wrote ""Overall, this is a solid addition to the [Ticket to Ride] line. I'd recommend picking it up if you're a fan who likes to have all the maps, or if you're in the market for your first Ticket to Ride game."" but added ""It's fun and the passengers/destination tickets add new strategic layers, but it's still Ticket to Ride at its heart. None of these additions change the game so much that you think, “Wow, this is what I've been looking for all of my life.""""


=== Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails ===

On 21 June 2016, Days of Wonder announced its pending release of a standalone version called ""Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails"", featuring a double-sided board with a world map on one side and a map of the Great Lakes region of North America on the other. The game premiered at that year's Gen Con (Booth #1829; 4–7 August 2016), before subsequently being released globally in early September 2016 at a suggested retail price of €70 / $80 (USD).
The game's board is the largest used in any Ticket to Ride game. This version contains train pieces and ship pieces, with a corresponding train card deck and ship card deck, to be played on land routes and on water routes respectively, as well as 3 harbour tokens for each player. The games was designed for 2–5 players aged 10-years or older for a game lasting 90–120 minutes. Alan R. Moon wrote:-

""Since our planet is about 70% water, when I started thinking about doing a world map for Ticket to Ride, it just seemed natural to add ships to the game. As I started laying the routes, it also became obvious that I would need some way to accommodate the longer ship routes. The double ship cards were the simple answer. To balance these powerful cards, I decided to put all the Wild Cards in the train deck.It was tough to figure out what the optimal mix of ships and trains was in the game. That led to the rules allowing players to choose their own mix of ships and trains at the start. Combining all of these elements created a game that has some fairly diverse strategies and what I hope is a totally refreshing Ticket to Ride experience.""
Reception – Opinions among the critics were mixed. Chris Way (Opinionated Gamers) wrote ""Rails & Sails continues the tradition, arguably even taking it to the next level by making the game more think-y.  Throw in the stunningly-beautiful double-sided map, and this could be a hit."" Brian Biewer (Board Game Quest) wrote ""I was not impressed with Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails. I appreciate the attempt at changing up the Ticket to Ride formula, but the increased luck factor combined with the increased game length reduced my enjoyment of the game. I would only recommend Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails to diehard Ticket to Ride fans who would not mind playing a longer version of Ticket to Ride that adds boats and a new set of cards to draw from.""


=== Ticket to Ride: Northern Lights ===
Released on 9 November 2022, this version is a standalone game featuring a map focused on the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), similar to the ""Ticket to Ride – Nordic countries"" version, but also contains cities in the Baltic nations (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland, and Russia. It differs from the ""Ticket to Ride – Nordic countries"" version, in that it recommends a game played with 2–5 players (compared to 2–3 players), and there are 11 bonuses, awarded by fulfilling varying conditions. This edition is mostly available in Scandinavia.


=== Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West ===
On 30 May 2023, Days of Wonder and Asmodee announced the release of this version on 3 November 2023. The game was premiered via a demonstration at Gen Con (3–6 August 2023), before being launched as scheduled in selected retailers and the Asmodee official store, at a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $119.99 (US). This version was designed by Alan R. Moon (Ticket to Ride), Matt Leacock (Pandemic), and Rob Daviau (Pandemic Legacy). The recommendation is that it is played with 2–5 players, who are aged 10 or older, for a game lasting between 20–90 minutes.
This version adapts of the original Ticket to Ride concept to the legacy format, i.e. a campaign board game where new content is gradually unlocked, through sealed boxes and envelopes, not only permanently changing the state of the game during play, thus altering the story as it unfolds, but also, permanently transforming the entire game into a unique version, depending on the outcomes of the previous games played. Matt Thrower (IGN), commenting on its legacy structure, wrote ""The fashion has moved on to more “resettable"" campaigns, but Ticket to Ride: Legacy sees you making permanent changes, resulting in a version of the game that's unique to you. While it's good to see this back, those changes feel less personal than they did in the earliest legacy games, and some of the mini-games are gone forever once they're over. So it's questionable how often your group might continue playing once the twelve games are up.""
This version is a standalone game containing 13 frontier boards, in the form of 13 jigsaw pieces (five of which make up your starting game board), which are unlocked gradually by completing the 12 games of this Ticket to Ride version During this version's 12 stages, players must complete tickets and build their fortune as they go from east to west in 19th century America, successfully managing their own North American railway company through various campaign adventures. This version uses the original basic rules, with the following additional rules specific to this version:

Money is earned, rather than points, and there are no default dollars in claiming routes like the original, with each player getting two points every time they build a route matching their player colour, and a bonus card if one of the cities connected has a large city icon (a small bonus to players who have completed tickets early).
There exist both a story deck and a postcard deck; with the former containing cards that are read out before and after each game in the series, offering a faux-historical narrative framework and occasionally setting new rules to incorporate into the game; and the latter being collected after the first game by completing certain tickets, offering rewards, to the player that owns it, if the specified objective has been achieved.
The train deck has several newspaper cards, shuffled into the train deck, resulting in a revealed event when drawn.
Adrien Martinot (Days of Wonder Game Line Manager), when describing the game, said “With Legends of the West, each game is different, with the story unfolding one layer at a time. New rules and game elements will punctuate this unique play experience, rife with unexpected events and cunning rivals.” The game creators noted that they deliberately omitted the real-world exploitation of Native Americans and railroad workers, stating that ""We found no way to include [these aspects] within the lighter theme of the game"", urging players to research the history in their own time.
Reception – The game received largely positive reviews. Matt Thrower (IGN), while giving the game a 9 out of 10, wrote ""A triumphant new turn on an aging series, proving there's good mileage in this old rolling stock yet. There's more than enough novelty here to thrill fans of the franchise without overwhelming less dedicated players, although if you want in, you'll need to commit to the campaign's duration."" Mollie Russell (Wargamer), while also giving the game a 9 out of 10, wrote ""Ticket to Ride Legacy is a game that feels great, even if the storytelling doesn't back its theme up. The simple concept of the original game translates well to a campaign-based experience, and there are enough treats and surprises to engage a legacy fan of any experience level.""


== First Journey versions ==
The First Journey series is designed for a younger audience (aged 6 and older), involving bigger pieces, a smaller board, shorter connections, with a quicker games time (10 – 30 minutes). The games are designed for 2 to 4 players. The games in this series were billed  as ""the perfect introduction to the Ticket to Ride series"" for younger players.
The rules of First Journey versions vary from the standalone versions. Notable changes to the rules of the classic version include: players are initially awarded only two mission cards, each automatically replaced when one is completed; and a points system is not used, with the winner determined by either the first to complete six destination tickets or the person with the most missions completed when one player places their final train.


=== America version ===
This was released in America as an exclusive in Target stores in 2016 at a suggested retail price of $(US) 34.99. The map is based on a map of America.


=== Europe version ===
In 2017, Days of Wonder would also create a version for Europe, with the same rules but a European map.
Reception – The Europe version won the following awards:


=== Ghost Train Version ===
On 7 July 2022, Days of Wonder forecast the release of a Junior Version based on the premise of the ""chilling journey"", revolving around a map of a fictitious ""hair-raising"" town. This version was released in both Europe and North America in September 2022 and then subsequently globally in October 2022.


== Cities versions ==
Cities versions maps are designed as standalone games featuring the original edition's standard gameplay, but with games that are shorter and smaller than the original edition. Each version in the cities line was designed for 2–4 players who are 8-years-old or older for a game lasting for 10–15 minutes. Allan J. Moon, when introducing the concept of the cities series, wrote ""This is the fastest way for new players to enter the Ticket to Ride world, but it's also a rewarding fifteen minutes game for Ticket to Ride veterans."" Each of the games in the cities series has a different unique additional scoring mechanism.


=== Ticket to Ride: New York ===
On 15 May 2018, Days of Wonder announced that a new ""express"" version of Ticket to Ride was being released called Ticket to Ride: New York, based on a 1960s map of the city of New York City (New York, United States). This version was released in North America and Europe in July 2018, at a suggested retail price of $20 (USD) and 20€ respectively, being released in the United states on 8 July 2018 exclusively through Target stores.
This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.25 out of 5 The unique point scoring feature was the claiming routes into tourist attraction destinations. Instead of trains, the tokens were taxis. The transportation cards represented a variety of common New York transport options:

Reception – The game received positive reviews, wih the majority of reviews focusing on the difference of the new cities-style of game from the format of the original versions. Mathew Bolton (T3 magazine), while giving the version 5 out of 5 stars, wrote ""I think if you play it over and over, every week, you might find that it lacks variety, but in all other cases, it's fantastic value for money."" Matt Jarvis (Table Top Gaming) wrote ""What Ticket to Ride: New York lacks in staying power compared to its bigger sibling, it absolutely makes up for with a breathless pace and absurdly compact size. Keep Ticket to Ride on your dining table – play Ticket to Ride: New York everywhere else."" While receiving praise, recurring general criticism of the cities line have been made. Andy Matthews (Meeple Mountain) wrote ""Days of Wonder have released a game which gives you the Ticket to Ride experience in a fraction of the time, but perhaps at the expense of long-term strategy.""
Emphasis was placed on its veracity as an introductory version to the Ticket to Ride series. Derek Thompson (Geek under Grace) wrote ""This is the definitive travel edition / lunchtime version of Ticket to Ride. It never overstays its welcome. It's a great introduction to the series for new players, and it's a great snack for gamers who don't have time for the full meal."" While awarding a 4 out of 5, AnnaMaria Jackson-Phelps (Board Game Quest) wrote ""Ticket to Ride: New York introduces nothing new but it's a great way to introduce new players to Ticket to Ride. Simplified rules and a smaller footprint make for faster teaching, faster setup, and faster games. Tourism in the Big Apple theme is enhanced by the breakneck speed of play, as well as the focus on taxis and notable Manhattan attractions."" Andy Matthews (Meeple Mountain) wrote ""With New York, Ticket to Ride proves yet again that it is one of the strongest brands in board gaming. This game is an excellent way to introduce your non-gaming friends to board gaming in a manner that's fast, fun, and easy to teach. ... Great little simplification of the Ticket to Ride series will make a great teaching tool, but doesn't add anything for seasoned players.""
On BoardGameGeek, based on a vote of 242 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.37 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 5.693.


=== Ticket to Ride: London ===
On 2 April 2019, Days of Wonder foreshadowed the release of a second installment to the cities line called Ticket to Ride – London, based on a 1970s map of London (England, United Kingdom). It was released in June 2019 in Europe and in July 2019 in North America, exclusively through Walmart in the United States, at a suggested retail price of €20 and $20 (USD) respectively.
This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.34 out of 5 This version used bus tokens instead of trains.  The game's unique scoring feature was based on the number of districts a player fully connects with their bus tokens. The transport cards are modes of transport imortalised by famous british songs, film and TV series:

Reception – The reviews of this London version were largely positive. Andrew Borck (Geeks under Grace) wrote ""This might be an odd game to start with in the Ticket to Ride line, but London does have a lot to offer in a small package. Especially for players looking for a quick route-building duel game or filler title. If you're a die-hard Ticket to Ride fan or looking for a quick, easy to setup and play game, well then London is calling."" Chris Way (opinionated Gamer) wrote ""Ticket to Ride is beautiful in its simplicity, and that shines through in London. I enthusiastically recommend this new entry in the famed series."" On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 4,692 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.09 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 6.583.


=== Ticket to Ride: Amsterdam ===
On 7 May 2020, Days of Wonder announced the pending release of a version called Ticket to Ride – Amsterdam, based on a 17th century map of the city of Amsterdam (Netherlands). This version was released in the Netherlands on 31 July 2020 Foreshadowed for a September 2020 release in North America generally, this version was available on 2 October 2020 in Canada and on 16 October 2024 in the United States. The game had a suggested retail price of €20 and $20 (USD) respectively.
This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.54 out of 5 Instead of trains, the tokens were horse-drawn carts. The unique scoring mechanism for this version was the accumulation of merchandise bonus cards, from routes claimed with a merchant cart on them located at the perimeter of the city. The transportation cards depict a variety of 17th century scenes:

Reception – Reviews were mixed. Andrew Borck (Geeks under Grace) wrote ""Overall it's a fun little addition to the Ticket to Ride line, but it doesn't add so much that you need to get it if you already have a similar small-box [Ticket to Ride] game. But as an entry-point game, it excels and will easily draw people in who might balk at the original's 60+ minute playtime.""  On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 1,383  voting users, holds an average rating of 6.98 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 6.066.


=== Ticket to Ride: San Francisco ===
On 5 May 2022, Days of Wonder announced the pending release of its fourth entry in the cities series entitled Ticket to Ride: San Francisco, based on a 1960s map of the San Francisco Bay Area (California, United States). In June 2022, this version was initially released in the United States, exclusively through Target stores, subsequently being realsed through other United States retailers during its global release in August 2022
This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.73 out of 5 Instead of trains, the pieces were cable cars. The unique scoring feature was the collection of cardboard tourist tokens of the city's famous landmarks positioned around the board. The transport cards depicted specific modes of transportation prevalent in San Francisco:

Reception – Critical reception was largely positive. On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 844 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.23 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 5.984. Andy Matthews (Meeple Mountain) wrote ""If you love Ticket to Ride and you'd like to expand your collection, San Francisco is a good addition. If you're just curious about the city versions, either San Francisco or New York are great choices."" However, for some critics this version compared less favourably to other versions in the cities series. Derek Thompson (Geeks under Grace) wrote ""I can't easily recommend it over New York, Amsterdam, or London, because I don't especially love the tokens. On one hand, I'm glad there are far fewer tokens to mess with than Ticket to Ride: Netherlands had. On the other hand, for me these small maps are also a pathway for my kids from Ticket to Ride: First Journey to regular Ticket to Ride. In that regard, I don't like having many extra rules, and I also find having the second player add the tokens somewhere kind of clunky, and confusing for young kids ... It's still Ticket to Ride, so it's still great, but I'd get it last among the current offerings in the line.""


=== Ticket to Ride: Berlin ===
On 9 May 2023, Days of Wonder announced a fifth instalment in the cities line entitled Ticket to Ride: Berlin, based on a map of 'current day' (2023) Berlin (Germany) featuring landmarks in the downtown area. This version was released on 25 August 2023 at a suggested retail price of €22.99 / $24.99 (USD).
This version has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.5 out of 5. The unique aspect of this game was that it used both tram (street car) tokens and underground (subway) tokens, instead of overground train carriage tokens, with routes specifically requiring the use of one of the two new types of tokens. The transport cards depicted specific modes of transportation prevalent in Berlin:

Reception – Reception to the Berlin map was largely positive. Adam Roffel (Game Reviews) wrote ""If you love Ticket to Ride as a game franchise, I think Berlin is the best small-box adaptation available."" On BoardGameGeek, based on a vote of 242 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.37 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 5.693.


=== Ticket to Ride: Paris ===
On 2 February 2024, Days of Wonder announced the sixth release in the Cities line entitled Ticket to Ride: Paris, based on a map of 1920s Paris (France). This version was released globally on 29 March 2024 at a suggested retail price of €22.99 and $24.99 (USD).
The unique scoring mechanism is the gaining of victory points by the waving of flags to celebrate Bastille Day through the completion of blue, white, and red route combinations. Instead of trains, the tokens were buses.


== Map collections ==
From 14 February 2011 until 15 April 2011, Alan J. Moon ran a ""Ticket to Ride Map Design Contest"", with an advertised $10,000 grand prize, to form the initial basis of a series of expansion maps. On 29 August 2011, it was announced that, of the 612 Ticket to Ride fans and prospective game designers from 40 different countries who compteted, two competators had won $10,000 each for their respective maps, i.e. Legendary Asia and India, which formed the basis of the first two volumes of the ""Map Collections"" series. Each game in the ""Map Collections"" series introduced new rules specific to that version, and required pieces from either the original or the Europe version of Ticket to Ride to play. The following Map Collections have been released to date:


=== Volume 1: Asia – Team Asia and Legendary Asia ===

On 29 August 2011, Days of Wonder announced the release of the first two volumes of a range of map expansions. The initial volume was entitled Volume 1: Asia - Team Asia and Legendary Asia, and featured a double-sided map of both Asia and Legendary Asia. The Legendary Asia map, submitted by François Valentyne of Toronto (Canada), was one of the two $10,000 grand prize winners of the 2011 ""Ticket to Ride Map Design Contest"". This expansion premiered at Spiel (20–23 October 2011) in Essen (Germany), after which it had a global release in late October 2011. The suggested retail price was €28 and $30 (USD) respectively.
This expansion currently has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.96 out of 5. Both maps are designed for players who were 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting 30–60 minutes. The unique feature of the Team Asia was that it was designed for two-member teams, to be played by even numbers of 2–6 players. The unique aspect of the Legendary Asia side was that it involved mountain routes, costing additional trains to build but giving bonus points. Legendary Asia was designed to be played by 2–5 players.
Reception – On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 6,023 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.65 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 7.079. The opinion of critics was favourable, with the consensus favouring the Team Asia side. Shannon Appelcline (RPG), while giving an overall 5 out of 5 for ""style"" and ""substance"", only gave an individual score of 4 out of 5 for substance for Legendary Asia, writing ""Ticket to Ride Asia offers two new and varied maps which will add some nice variety to your Ticket to Ride play. It's well worthwhile just on that basis, given the very reasonable price point. However, Ticket to Ride Asia really knocks things out of the park with its Team Asia rules, which allow you to play as partners for 4-player or 6-player games. The result is one of the most enjoyable, stressful, and innovative ways to play Ticket to Ride since the release of the original game."" Dale Yu (Opinionated Gamers) wrote ""I definitely like the ideas in Legendary Asia, but I suspect that it is the Team Asia map that will cause me to take this one off the shelf more.""


=== Volume 2: India + Switzerland ===
On 29 August 2011 Days of Wonder foreshadowed the release of an expansion entitled Volume 2: India + Switzerland based on a 1911 map of India on one side and a map of Switzerland on the other. The India map was sumitted by Ian Vincent, was one of the two $10,000 grand prize winners of the 2011 ""Ticket to Ride Map Design Contest"". The switzerland map was a re-release of the 2007 Ticket to Ride: Switzerland edition's map. This expansion was released in December 2011 at a suggested retail price of €28 / $30 (USD).

This expansion currently has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.02 out of 5. Both maps in this expansion were designed for players who are 8-years-old or older for a game lasting 30–60 minutes, however, the indian map was designed for 2–4 players, while the Switzerland map was designed for 2–3 players. India had a unique bonus for connecting destinations in a mandala (loop of routes). Switzerland had a unique bonus for joining two of the countries neighbouring Switzerland together.
Reception –  Shannon Appelcline (RPG), while giving it a 5 out of 5 for ""style"" and a 4 out of 5 for ""substance"" wrote ""Overall, Ticket to Ride Switzerland is just as good as any other Ticket to Ride game, and that means it's a lot of fun to play, has great tension, and allows good strategy for a short game. I've given it a slightly lower rating than previous games, because it's no longer fresh and innovative, but it still earns an above average 4 out of 5 for Substance."" On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 6,236 voting users, this expasion holds an average rating of 7.77 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 7.173.


=== Volume 3: The Heart of Africa ===
On 24 September 2012, Days of Wonder foreshadowed the then upcoming release of an expansion entitled Volume 3: The Heart of Africa, based on a 1910 map of the Africa continent. In December 2012, it was released at a suggested retail price of €25 / $25 (USD).
This expansion currently has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.05 out of 5. This version's unique feature was ""terrain cards"", which gave a double point bonus when claiming a route if the ""terrain cards"" matched the routes claimed. The game was designed for 2–5 players who are 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting 30–60 minutes.
Reception – This extension received largely favourable reviews, with especially positive mentions about the unique ""terrain card"" mechanism. Matt Morgan (Wired) wrote ""Worth the challenge. Ticket to Ride hasn't been this competitive in a while, and new terrain cards keep the game fresh."" Shannon Appelcline (RPGNet), while giving the game a 5 out of 5 for ""style"", gave this expansion a 4 out of 5 for ""substance"", writing Ticket to Ride Map Collection 3: The Heart of Africa offers up some terrific play for experienced Ticket to Ride game players. The tightness of the map and the additional level of strategy created by the new rules combine to create a more interesting, more thoughtful, and more tense game."", but adding ""It's got some good material for Ticket to Ride players, but I'd suggest getting the other two Map Collections first."" On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 3,300 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.38 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 6.626.


=== Volume 4: Nederland ===
On 17 September 2013, Days of Wonder foreshadowed a fourth expansion called Volume 4: Nederland, based on a single-sided map of the Netherlands. The expansion premiered at Spiel (24–27 October 2013) in Essen (Germany), to launch its simultaneous European release, after which it had its global release in November 2013.  The game had a retail price of €25 and $25 (USD) respectively.
This expansion currently has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.13 out of 5. The game was designed for 2–5 players, who are 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting 30–60 minutes. This was the first Ticket to Ride version with a currency system, used to pay bridge tolls for a player's routes. A bridge toll bonus is awarded at the end of the game, the total of which is related to the total worth of bridge toll tokens held by each player, in relationship to each other. Allan J. Moon wrote:

""Players must manage their limited treasury and this affects their choices of routes. The huge bonus for the most money at the end of the game makes it even harder to spend money during the game. Most of the time, the player with the most economically efficient route will win.""
Reception – The toll system was criticised. Edwin van de Sluis (Gamepack) wrote ""At the end there seems to be an accidental winner of the end bonus so it seems (or feels). Playing with a focus on both end bonus and fulfilling tickets seems pretty difficult, so it seems, and raises the question whether this is possible at all.""

=== Volume 5: United Kingdom + Pennsylvania ===

On 25 August 2015, Days of Wonder announced the upcoming release of an expansion entitled Volume 5: United Kingdom + Pennsylvania based on a double-sided map, with a  map of turn of the 19th century United Kingdom on one side and a map of Pennsylvania on the other. This expansion premiered at booths 1-F122 and 3-B108 of Spiel (8–11 October 2015) in Essen (Germany), shortly before its Europe release, after which, this expansion had a global release in November 2015. The suggested retails price was released €35 and $39.99 (USD) respectively.
Currently, this expansion has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.30 out of 5. United Kingdom introduces a unique technology system, requiring upgrades to complete certain routes, while Pennsylvania introduces a unique stock market system. This expansion was designed for 2–6 players, 8-years-old of older, for a game lasting for 30–75 minutes. Alan J. Moon wrote:

""Ticket to Ride Pennsylvania is perhaps the simplest expansion of all in terms of the additional rules, but adds a lot to the strategic choices of what routes to build and when to build them. Don't be surprised to see this mechanic or something close to it in future expansions.""
Ticket to Ride United Kingdom on the other hand changes the basic system more than any other expansion. The limited starting technology forces players to make some early strategic choices, often forcing them to all build in the same area around London, and vying for crucial routes in the north of England. But as the game continues, players can take quite a few different paths to victory, focusing on bonus points, on tickets, on long routes, and more.

Reception – Critical reaction to this expansion was mixed. Owen Duffy wrote ""For fans of Ticket to Ride, this is a great addition to a favourite game. If you're a former player who's moved on to other things, then the UK Map Pack might just draw you back in. It keeps the core simplicity that's made the game a worldwide hit, but it adds a level of depth and variety that's fresh and challenging. It manages all of this without venturing into the level of complexity you'll find in niche titles aimed at hardcore train enthusiasts. If that sounds like your idea of fun, climb aboard!"" Dan Street Phillips (Toy Street), while rating it 4.70 out of 5 based on 5913 Reviews, wrote ""This collection, for me, adds some of the most exciting and interesting mechanisms into the game. The stocks are great but what really shines in the Ticket To Ride United Kingdom map and all of its technologies. If you have played the base game enough for it to get a little stale then jump on board and buy a ticket for the sunny isle of Great Britain!"" In contrast there was some negative criticisms. Matt Thrower (There will be Games), while awarding the expansion 2 out of 5, wrote ""UK map is a disappointment. The new technology mechanic feels like a crapshoot and actually seems to narrow the strategies available rather than increase them. Pennsylvania map is much better, and the added points from company investment is interesting, but not good enough to make the whole worthwhile."" Miniature Market, while giving the expansion a 2.5 out of 5, wrote that ""All in all, this expansion's biggest flaw is being rather unremarkable. It's fine, but nothing special. ... If you're tired of putting plastic trains down from Seattle to New York, you could do worse than playing UK/Pennsylvania. You could do better as well, but you could do worse."" On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 5,704 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.99 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 7.300. This expansion received the following award recognition:


=== Volume 6: France + Old West ===
On 22 August 2017, Days of Wonder announced the pending release of an expansion called Volume 6: France + Old West, based on a map of late 19th century France, described as being ""set during the height of Impressionism and the Industrial Revolution"", on one side and a 19th century map of the old west on the other. This expansion premiered at Spiel (26 – 29 October 2017)  at the same time as its October release in Europe, after which the expansion was released in the United States in November 2017. It was sold at a suggested price of €40 and $44.99 (USD) respectively.
Currently, this expansion has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.10 out of 5. The unique aspect of the France map was that most of the routes on the board are not colored track routes, but rather track beds, requiring each player to lay tracks to decide the colour of the route in advance, before any player can claim that route. The main unique aspect of the Old West map was that train routes were only able to be claimed, when connected to a players own initially placed city, either directly or through that players own train routes. An additional optional unique feature of the Old West map was that 10 points were scored by a player reaching Roswell, thus activating the ""Alvin the Alien"" counter piece which was moved from station to station throughout the game, and/or possessing the ""Alvin the Alien"" token at the end of the game. Both maps in this expansion were designed for 2–6 players, who are 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting for 60–90 minutes.
Reception – This expansion gained some negative reviews. Andrew Smith (Board Game Quest), while grading it with a ""pass"", wrote ""Even for the most die-hard fans, it is hard to recommend. As a one-time experience, the France and Old West expansion isn't bad, but I can't imagine myself wanting to continue to pull this off the shelf. It feels like a longer, more annoying version of the same game and the France track laying is way more trouble than it's worth. There are plenty of other map packs that give you more variety without all the restrictions and longer play time."" However, on BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 1,958 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.62 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 6.512.


=== Volume 6 1/2: Poland ===
On 28 June 2019, an expansion of Ticket to Ride was released based on a map of 1950s Poland, but this time as a Polish language version created and released exclusively for the Polish market, published by Rebel under the Polish name Wsiąść do Pociągu – Polska. In early December 2019, an English version was accessible throughout the rest of Europe from online merchants, through a limited sale lasting until January 2020. On 19 April 2022, it was announced that a physical version of the Poland expansion would have a wider release as an English version, being available in July 2022 throughout Europe and in September 2022 throughout North America, at a suggested retail price of €22.99 and $24.99 (USD) respectively.
Currently, this expansion has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 1.67 out of 5. The recommendation is that it is played with 2–4 people, who are 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting 30–60 minutes. This expansion has the smallest map board in the series, having only 4 sections as opposed to the standard 6. Gameplay has an emphasis on connections between neighbouring countries for bonus points.
Reception – The expasion received overal positive, but not extatic, reviews. Andrew Borck (Geeks under Grace), while giving this version a 7 out of 10, wrote ""The new mechanic of connecting neighboring countries is a nice way to get more points, and it forces players to go to the edges of the map."" but added that this was a version that ""Brings new ideas to the table, but ultimately not a 'must buy' expansion."" On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 680 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.48 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 5.969.


=== Volume 7: Japan + Italy ===
On 10 September 2019 Days of Wonder announced the pending release of an expansion called Volume 7: Japan + Italy, based on a map of current day (2019) Japan on one side and early 20th century Italy on the other. It premiered at booth 3-B107 of Spiel (24 – 27 October 2019) in Essen, Germany, slightly ahead of its November 2019 European release, at a suggested retail price of 40€. Subsequently, it was released in the United States on 31 January 2020 as part of its January 2020 North American release at a suggested retail price of $40 (USD), and then in mid-February 2020 in Japan via Hobby Japan at a retail price of 5,600 yen (excluding tax).
Currently, this expansion has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.07 out of 5. The unique aspect of the Japan side is the Shinkansen, whose bullet train routes are collaboratively built and accessible to anyone, so when one of those routes in claimed all players can use it to complete destination tickets, with the player/s who contributed more to the shared project getting a larger bonus. The reverse Italy side features a new ferry route mechanism, i.e. instead of drawing two train cards you can draw one ferry card, and adds a new scoring rule for Italian provinces. There is no ""Globetrotter"" or ""Longest Route"" bonus in either the Italy or Japan game. The recommendation is that it is played with 2–5 players, who are aged 8 or older, for a game lasting between 30–60 minutes.
Reception – Game Board Memo, in a review of the Italy side that gave it a 7/10, wrote that ""In terms of the balance between the lack of additional rules and the amount of fun, the cost performance is on par with the German map."" Jessica Walker (Zatu Games), while giving this expansion a score of 90%, wrote ""Ticket to Ride Japan and Italy is an excellent expansion and both maps offer very different Ticket to Ride experiences from one another. Japan is one of the best and most unique Ticket to Ride maps available. Italy is more standard but is a fun map nonetheless. Neither map is too much of a step up in rules from either Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride Europe. If you have played the base game a lot and want to spice things up, this expansion is the perfect place to start.""  (Geeks under Grace) wrote ""Overall, it's a really good package, with only a few minor downfalls. It's a bit pricey and the box is way too big (though you could combine some map packs into this box). While the Italy map is not super exciting, I'm still happy to get two maps instead of one, and Japan is one of the best maps they've ever done for Ticket to Ride. If your group still plays Ticket to Ride regularly, then this is an expansion worth getting.""  On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 2,170 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 7.90 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 6.693.


=== Stay at Home ===
On 28 May 2020, Days of Wonder announced their release of an expansion called Stay at Home, in recognition of the global lockdown which resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ticket to Ride: Stay at Home marked the first time that an expansion in the Ticket to Ride series had been set entirely inside a house, where instead of forming railway routes between cities across the world, players controlled family members as they moved around the house from locations, like the balcony, kitchen and bedroom, as they attempted to go about their daily lives. This version functioned as an expansion of the original, Europe, Germany, or Nordic Countries Ticket to Rides, based on a print-out of a pdf map download.
Currently, this expansion has a BoardGameGeek complexity rating of 2.00 out of 5. The game was designed to be played by 2–4 players, aged 8 years-old and over, for a game lasting 20–40 minutes. This expansion had a unique game mechanism involving multicolored ""family routes"" onto which multiple players can place their train cars along it, with players who had at least one train along it being able to use it to complete their missions.
Reception – On BoardGameGeek, from a vote of 184 voting users, this version holds an average rating of 5.623 and an ""Adjusted Geek"" rating of 7.10. This expansion received the following award recognition:


=== Volume 8: Iberia + South Korea ===
In 2024, Days of Wonder and Asmodee foreshadowed on their respective websites the 28 June 2024 release of a new expansion entitled Volume 8: Iberia + South Korea, based on a map of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), on one side and South Korea on the other. The Iberia map had originally been published as an unofficial fan expansion in 2015.
This exansion currently has a complexity rating on BoardGameGeek of 2 out of 5. Both maps in the expansion are designed for 2–4 players, who are 8-years-old or older, for a game lasting 30–60 minutes.


== Card game ==


=== Ticket to Ride: The Card Game ===
The card game was released in the summer of 2008 and includes a similar artistic style and theme, and general game mechanism to the set collection. The card game is playable in 30–45 minutes and supports 2–4 players. Players start with 1 locomotive card and 7 other random train cards in their hands. Players are also dealt 6 destination tickets of which they must keep at least 1. The destination tickets have 1 to 5 coloured dots which match the colours of the train cards. To complete a destination ticket, players must move cards from their hand to their rail yard (playing area directly in front of the player), and finally to their on-the-track stack (scoring area). During play, players can ""train rob"" another player, by playing more of a specific colour than their opponent has in their rail yard. When the train card draws piles are exhausted, the players use the train cards in their on-the-track stack to complete their destination tickets, by matching the coloured train cards with the coloured dots on the destination tickets. Completed tickets are added to the player's score, while uncompleted tickets are subtracted. Additional bonus points are awarded to players who complete the most tickets to the six big cities, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Seattle.
Reception – Ticket to Ride: The Card Game won the following awards:


== Hoax versions ==
As part of April Fool's Day (1 April 2024), via its Facebook page, Days of Wonder forecast the release of an addition to the Cities line entitled Ticket to Ride: A Moon Adventure, designed for 12 players (the 12 astronauts who had set foot on the Moon), with the unique objective being to complete missions before blasting off back to Earth, and a release date 6 years in the future (horizon of 2030). The transport cards were supposedly types of rockets with the wild cards as satellites.


== Computer games ==

Ticket to Ride and most expansions can be played online at Days of Wonder's website. A four-game free trial subscription is available. Due to the major browsers and Adobe discontinuing support for Flash, the future of this version of the game is uncertain.


=== The Computer Game ===

In February 2017 Days of Wonder abandoned Linux support. However, the version available on Steam was playable on Linux. On September 27, 2023 it was announced that this version of the game would be sunsetted to make way for a new version developed by Marmalade Games. It was delisted from PC and mobile storefronts on October 3, 2023.
This version received mixed reviews on Steam and Google Play on release due to technical issues and a lack of features compared to the previous version. However, after release, the game received generally favourable reviews.

On 2 August 2012, Ticket to Ride: Legendary Asia was added, and in April 2016, Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries became available.
The iPad version of Ticket to Ride was named the 2011 Digital Game of the Year by the Danish Guldbrikken (The Golden Pawn) Awards, which referred to the game as ""the exemplar of how a board game makes the leap to the digital world without compromise. The iPad version dazzles with its superb finish, easy availability and unparalleled expandability, as well as the ability to play on just the iPad or over the Internet.""


=== iPhone and iPod Touch ===
The iPhone version was released on 16 November 2011, which is a simplified version of the iPad game. Online play was added as an update on 2 February 2012, and users can also play a multi-player game on a local network via WiFi or Bluetooth.

On 6 April 2024, Ticket to Ride featured in a comedy sketch on Saturday Night Live (episode 16, Season 49), invloving guests Kristen Wiig and Will Forte, as well as regulars Andrew Dismukes, Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman, and Bowen Yang, in which a dinner party guest (Wiig) is afraid to play Ticket to Ride for fear of being ""Jumanji'd"" thus prompting a semantic debate about how the film and narrative of Jumanji worked, before the seemingly irrational guest's fears are realised when a train conductor (Forte) enters to jumanjii the other dinner party guests.
